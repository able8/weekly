1. [Location-Aware Distribution: Configuring servers at scale](https://code.fb.com/data-infrastructure/location-aware-distribution-configuring-servers-at-scale/)

    With millions of servers and thousands of configuration changes per day, distribution of configuration information becomes a huge scaling challenge. Here’s some insight (and pretty architecture diagrams) explaining how Facebook does it.Ali Haider Zaveri — Facebook [NOTE: originally miscredited, sorry!]

1. [Transparent SLIs: See Google Cloud the way your application experiences it](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ClPlBl/~3/HATjLhZVggk/transparent-slis-see-google-cloud-the-way-your-application-experiences-it.html)

    This pretty neat: Google Cloud Platform now exposes their SLIs directly to you, as they pertain to the requests you make of the platform. For example, if a given API call has increased latency, you’ll see it on their graph. This can be great for those “is it us or is it them?” incidents.Jay Judkowitz — Google

    Here’s a review of Google’s new SRE book. I’m a little miffed that now I have to say that, instead of just “Google’s SRE book” or just “the SRE book”. Ah well. This one appears to be more about practical use cases than theory.Todd Hoff — High Scalability
