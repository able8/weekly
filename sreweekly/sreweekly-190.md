1. [PostgreSQL Connection Pooling: Part 1 – Pros & Cons](http://highscalability.com/blog/2019/10/18/postgresql-connection-pooling-part-1-pros-cons.html)

1. [Four Key Attributes of Advanced Anomaly Detection](https://www.datanami.com/2019/10/18/four-key-attributes-of-advanced-anomaly-detection/)

    This article is about attributes, but it doesn’t mention a specific system. I have yet to find an anomaly detection system that doesn’t produce so many false positives that it’s useless.Hive mind: if you’re using an anomaly detection system that actually works and doesn’t drown you with false positives, I want to hear about it. Bonus points if you want to write an article about it!Amit Levi
