### Outages

1. [Telstra](http://m.thenewdaily.com.au/news/2016/03/22/telstra-struck-outage/)
    This makes the third major outage (plus a minor one) this year.  Customers are getting pretty mad.
1. [Gliffyhangops](http://support.gliffy.com/entries/98911057--Gliffy-Online-System-Outage)
    Gliffy suffered a heartbreaking 48-hour outage after an administrator mistakenly deleted the production db.  They do have backups, but the backups take a long time to restore.

1. [The Division (game)](http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/654222/The-Division-Down-PS4-Xbox-One-Ubisoft-Mike-errors-Log-in-issues)
1. [DigitalOceanhangops](https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/update-on-the-march-24-2016-dns-outage/)
    A day after the incident, DigitalOcean posted an excellent postmortem.  I like that they clearly explained the technical details behind the incident.  While they mentioned the DDoS attack, they didn’t use it to try to avoid taking responsibility for the downtime.  Shortly after this was posted, it spurred a great conversation on hangops #incident_response that included the post’s author.
