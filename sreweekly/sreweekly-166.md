    One of my favorite moments of SRECon: during their talk, Dorothy Jung and Wenting Wang unveiled this choose-your-own-adventure-style game for practicing your incident response skills. See if you can resolve the incident before your stress level gets too high!Chie Shu, Dorothy Jung, Joel Salas, Dennis So, Sam Faber-Manning, and Wenting Wang — Yelp
1. [SRECon19 Americas interesting tidbits](https://www.lexneva.name/blog/2019/03/30/srecon19-americas-interesting-tidbits/)

    Last week was only the second SRECon I’ve managed to attend. Rather than post raw notes from all the talks I attended, I tried something different: I only wrote down the really big stuff that made me think or blew my mind. I’m hoping that just reading this might give those of you that weren’t able to attend a taste of the conference.Lex Neva

    This article goes into what the pilots of the Lion Air 737 Max 8 (and presumably the Ethiopian Airlines one as well) would have had to do in order to regain control over the aircraft. We’re starting to get hints of the task saturation and alert overload both sets of pilots may have faced as they tried to handle the situation:Thanks to Courtney Eckhardt for this one.Sean Gallagher — Ars Technica

    The day before Lion Air’s 737 Max 8 crash last fall, the exact same plane had a similar failure to the one that may have taken that plane down the next day.Thanks to Courtney Eckhardt for this one.Alan Levin and Harry Suhartono — Bloomberg
1. [Calvin: fast distributed transactions for partitioned database systems](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/29/calvin-fast-distributed-transactions-for-partitioned-database-systems/)

    Calvin is interesting for (at least) two reasons: first, it’s designed to work with an existing database, and second, it manages an impressively fast transaction throughput rate.Adrian Colyer (summary) — The Morning PaperThomson et al. (original paper)
1. [Monitoring distributed systems means first, do no harm](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/news/252460370/Monitoring-distributed-systems-means-first-do-no-harm)

    This article draws an interesting parallel between two talks at SRECon last week, about making sure that your monitoring doesn’t itself cause incidents.Beth Pariseau — TechTarget
