    I previously shared an article about the 737 MAX 8, and I’m truly saddened that another accident has occurred. Learning from accidents like this is incredibly important, and the NTSB is among the best at it. I look forward to see what we can take away from this to make air travel even safer.

    The existence of this anonymous channel for pilots is really interesting to me. It sounds like a great way to learn about near misses, which can be nearly identical to catastrophic accidents. Can we implement this kind of anonymous channel in our organizations too?Thom Patterson and Aaron Cooper — CNN
