1. [Manageable On-Call for Companies without Money Printers](https://www.softwareatscale.dev/p/manageable-on-call-for-companies)

    The SRE book has a chapter covering on-call, but it’s best suited for huge-scale companies. What should the rest of us do?Utsav Shah
1. [Breaking the top five myths around chaos engineering](https://cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2021/apr/28/breaking-the-top-five-myths-around-chaos-engineering/)

    If you’re feeling hesitant about chaos engineering, or you’re trying to convince someone who is, this might be useful. The myths are:Mikolaj Pawlikowski
1. [Seeing Like an SRE: Site Reliability Engineering as High Modernism](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/seeing-sre-site-reliability-engineering-high-modernism)

    Drawing parallels to the high modernism movement during the cold war, this article raises interesting questions about the direction SRE is going, and system administration in general.Laura Nolan — USENIX
1. [Is faster actually safer? How software physics beats human psychology ](https://www.merkely.com/blog/is-faster-actually-safer-how-software-physics-beats-human-psychology./)

    Riffing off of a tweet by Charity Majors, this article explores the idea that moving faster can actually be safer, despite an urge one may feel to slow down.Bruce Johnston
1. [NTSB Aircraft Accident Report: Eastern Air Lines, May 5, 1983](http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR84-04.pdf)

    An extreme oversimplification of this incident would be: multiple engine failure on a plane subsequent to a maintenance error on all engines. This accident is cited as a reason to have separate mechanics work on each engine, in hopes of avoiding duplicated errors.US National Transportation Safety Board (multiple authors)
1. [How we ship code faster and safer with feature flags](https://github.blog/2021-04-27-ship-code-faster-safer-feature-flags/)

1. [Reverse debugging at scale](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/04/27/developer-tools/reverse-debugging/)

    This one blew my mind. By recording instruction execution traces in a ring buffer, they’re able to reconstruct enough information to step through the execution leading up to a crash — even though they weren’t running the application under a debugger!Walter Erquinigo, David Carrillo-Cisneros, Alston Tang — Facebook
1. [The Plane Paradox: More Automation Should Mean More Training](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-the-plane-paradox-more-automation-should-mean-more-training/)

    Automation is supposed to take some of the load off of the human operator, right? But in reality, humans need to build a mental model of what the automation is doing in order to use it safely and effectively.Shem Malmquist — WIRED
