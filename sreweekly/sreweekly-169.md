1. [Boeing’s crisis: AOPA safety expert weighs in](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2019/march/21/aopa-safety-expert-weighs-in-on-boeing-crisis)

    My coworker pointed me toward this article, and we had a really great conversation. I shared this article that I’d linked previously here, and it hit me: Boeing (and the FAA?) assumed MCAS was fine because a failure in it would look like a normal kind of failure with an established recovery procedure.The problem is, we’ve seen that the recovery procedure can fail if the plane is moving so fast toward the ground that the pilots can’t physically pull it out of a dive. And it seems possible that no one knew that the recovery mechanism had this fatal vulnerability. This has all the hallmarks of a classic complex failure.Thanks to John Goerzen for this one.Richard McSpadden — AOPA
