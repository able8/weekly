### Articles

1. [Implementing Semantic Monitoring](https://medium.com/production-ready/implementing-semantic-monitoring-534f16e18247#.8qs216730)

    In this issue of Production Ready, Mathias shows how his team set up semantic monitoring. They continuously run integration tests and feed the results into their monitoring system, rather than running CI only when building new code.
1. [Gotham Perils: Clifford Chance Sues City Over Construction Outage](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/01/27/gotham-perils-clifford-chance-sues-city-over-construction-outage/)

    By “construction outage”, the headline means “a network outage due to a fiber cut that was caused by construction”. It will be interesting to see whether this suit is successful.
1. [On-Call Handoffs: Empowering Adaptability in Incident Response](https://victorops.com/blog/on-call-handoffs/)

    Recommendations for an on-call hand-off procedure. It’s geared toward using the VictorOps platform, but the main ideas apply more broadly. I like the idea of reviewing deploys as well as incidents and for running a monthly review of handoffs.This article is published by my sponsor, VictorOps, but their sponsorship did not influence its inclusion in this issue.
