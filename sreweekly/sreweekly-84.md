## [SRE Weekly Issue #84](https://sreweekly.com/sre-weekly-issue-84/) - August 6, 2017
### Articles

1. [Availability Calculator](https://dastergon.github.io/availability-calculator/)

    How many minutes per month is 99.95% availability? What about 99.957%? Here’s a tool that’ll give you a quick answer, by the author of awesome-sre.
1. [Chaos Engineering: A Lesson From the Experts – DZone Performance](https://dzone.com/articles/chaos-engineering-a-lesson-from-the-experts)

    This article is a partial transcript of Catchpoint’s Chaos Engineering and DiRT AMA.
1. [When production is your test lab – what is “canarying”?](https://www.enterpriseirregulars.com/117624/production-test-lab-canarying/)

    Somewhat intro-level, but I like this little gem:
1. [Designing for Scale, Part 3: Scaling Under Stress](https://dzone.com/articles/designing-for-scale-part-3-scaling-under-stress)

    This article chronicles New Relic’s attempt to test a new system to prove that it was ready for production.
1. [FIFO, Exactly-Once, and Other Costs](http://bravenewgeek.com/fifo-exactly-once-and-other-costs/)

    SQS, Kafka, and others tout features like “exactly once” and “FIFO”, but there are necessarily some pretty big caveats and edge cases to those features that really can’t be ignored.
1. [The SRE model](https://medium.com/@rakyll/the-sre-model-6e19376ef986)

    Really, the title should be “The Google SRE Model”. This article discusses Google’s philosophy that the SRE team is optional for any given system — but a team should be doing what SRE would be doing if they’re not around.
1. [Building mOps (Modern Ops Process): Transparent Status and RCAs](https://medium.com/synqfm-ops/building-mops-modern-ops-process-transparent-status-and-rcas-72b716964bb8)

    SYNQ pushes for transparency in incident response and commits to publishing their RCAs publicly (like this one). They also include a simple template for RCAs at the end of the article.

    A large portion of Canada had a major mobile phone and internet outage due to a fiber cut.
1. [Herokustatus page](https://status.heroku.com/incidents)
    Heroku has had a string of major outages, marked as red on their status page. Apologies for not linking to them individually and as they’ve happened, but here’s a link to their historical list. No public statement has been posted yet.
Full disclosure: Heroku is my employer.
