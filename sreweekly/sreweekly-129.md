### Articles

1. [Linux Kernel bug hunting](https://medium.com/booking-com-infrastructure/linux-kernel-bug-hunting-35f648c8dbb7)

    What do you do when your hosts have kernel crashes at random every day? It turns out that you don’t need to be a seasoned kernel programmer to find a solution.Pavlos Parissis — Booking.com
1. [Detecting who used the EC2 metadata server with BCC](https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/detecting-who-used-ec2-metadata-server-bcc/?utm_source=last_week_in_AWS&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=website&utm_source=Last%20Week%20in%20AWS&utm_medium=email)

    This is my first introduction tcpconnect (part of BCC). Pretty nifty!fREW Schmidt

1. [A Chaos Engineering Gameday Report Template](http://michael-kehoe.io/post/chaos-gameday-template/)

    A couple weeks back, I linked to a postmortem template. Here’s a gameday report template from the same author.Michael Kehoe
1. [Bare Metal K8s Clustering at Chick-fil-A Scale](https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/bare-metal-k8s-clustering-at-chick-fil-a-scale-7b0607bd3541)

    I had a really hard time choosing whether to include this one. On the one hand, it’s a really interesting article about service discovery in franchises that has to work right every time. On the other hand, Chick-fil-A has a terrible track record on GLBT rights, and I can’t overlook that.Ultimately, I’m choosing to link to this article for its educational content, but I urge you to join me as I continue to boycott Chick-fil-A. Brian Chambers, Caleb Hurd, and Alex Crane — Chick-fil-A
1. [Source Code Is A Liability, Not An Asset](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/elee/2009/03/11/source-code-is-a-liability-not-an-asset/)

    At 9 years old, this may be the oldest article I’ve linked to, but it’s worth it. The analogy to a home mortage is spot on.Eric Lee
1. [Scaling a monitoring platform to over 9,600 bank integrations](https://blog.plaid.com/scaling-a-monitoring-platform/)

    Click through to read about an interesting monitoring challenge and an account of how they solved it. I appreciate the emphasis on the importance of educating engineers to spread the knowledge of how the new system works among more people.Joy Zheng and Jeeyoung Kim — Plaid
1. [Chaos Engineering – withstanding turbulent conditions in production](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2018/07/chaos-engineering/)

    Another chaos engineering introduction. Why should you read it? If nothing else, the architecture diagram with the skull and cobwebs on it is pretty great. It’s also well worth reading if you’re looking to create a chaos engineering game plan.Benjamin Wilms — Codecentric
1. [Leaks, riots, and monocles: How a $60 in-game item almost destroyed EVE Online](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/07/monocles.ars)

    Sometimes, a reliability risk can come in the form of a bunch of angry customers.Ben Kuchera — Ars Technica
