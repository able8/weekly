1. [npmTravisHerokupostmortemgithub issue](http://status.npmjs.org/incidents/nl2mpgltpnvj)
    NPM had an 8+ hour outage that left many build system providers such as Travis, CircleCI, and Heroku and individual users scrambling.  Their postmortem indicates that a major end-of-day deploy the day before was to blame.  Conversation in a related github issue suggests a monitoring gap and a lack of overnight on-call coverage for complex outages such as this one.
Full disclosure: Heroku, my employer, is mentioned.
