1. [Spain rail system: have rail incident investigations been compromised?](https://www.railway-technology.com/features/spain-rail-system/)

    The concern is that incidents have been investigated by parties that were involved or related to the incident, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. In a small company, avoiding this kind of thing may not be possible, but we should at least keep the risks in mind.Patrick Kingsland — Railway Technology

1. [The psychology behind a blameless retrospective](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/psychology-behind-blameless-retrospective)
