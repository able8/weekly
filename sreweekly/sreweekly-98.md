1. [IT Incident Command and Incident Management Course](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/it-incident-command-and-incident-management-tickets-39529284153?aff=eac2)

    I’ve mentioned Blackrock3 Partners here before, a team of veteran firefighters that train IT incident responders in the same Incident Management System used by firefighters and other disaster responders. Before now, they’ve only done training and consulting directly with companies.Now, for the first time, they are opening a training session to the public, so you can learn to be an Incident Commander (IC) without having to be at a company that contracts with them. Their training will significantly up your incident response game, so don’t miss out on this. Click through for information on tickets.Blackrock3 Partners has not provided me with compensation in any form for including this link.

    Google claims a lot with Cloud Spanner. Does it deliver? I’d really like to see a balanced, deeply technical review, so if you know of one, please drop me a link.
1. [On-Call Horror Story Number Four: This Wins the Most Debilitating Award](https://victorops.com/blog/call-horror-story-number-four-wins-debilitating-award/)

    Ever been on-call for work and your baby? I think a fair number of us can relate. Thankfully, it sounds like these folks realized that it’s not exactly a best practice to have a parent of a 5-day old premie be on call…
1. [Fault, Error, Failure; Availability and Stability](http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/2016/11/fault)

    Here’s a nice pair of articles on fault tolerance and availability. In the first post (linked above), the author defines the terms “fault”, “error”, and “failure”. The second post starts with definitions of “availability” and “stability” and covers ways of achieving them.
1. [[John Allspaw] My Next Step](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2017/11/13/my-next-step/)
