1. [Learning from incidents – Formula 1](https://incident.io/blog/learning-from-incidents-in-formula-1)

    The incident: a formula 1 car hit the side barrier just over 20 minutes before the race was about to start. The team sprang into action with an incredibly calm, orderly and speedy incident response to replace the damaged parts faster than they ever have before.This article is a great analysis, and there’s also an excellent 8-minute video that I highly recommend. Listen to the way the sporting director and everyone else communicates so calmly. It’s a rare treat to get video footage of a production incident like this. Chris Evans — incident.io

1. [Culture & Conduct Risk: The Normalization of Deviance](https://www.regulationasia.com/culture-conduct-risk-the-normalization-of-deviance/)

    Drawing from the “normalization of deviance” concept introduced in the Challenger disaster study [Diane Vaughan], this article explores the idea of studying your organization culture to catch problems early, rather than waiting to respond after they happen.Stephen Scott
1. [Lorin Hochstein (Netflix) [StaffEng Podcast]](https://podcast.staffeng.com/1687069/8930850-lorin-hochstein-netflix)

    This episode of the StaffEng Podcast is an interview with Lorin Hochstein, whose writings I’ve featured here numerous times. My favorite part of this episode is when they talk about doing incident analysis for near misses. One of the hosts points out that it’s much easier for folks to talk about what happened, because there was no incident so they’re not worried about being blamed.
