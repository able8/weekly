1. [Pinboard.inPinboard](https://twitter.com/SREWeekly/status/881695417355956225)
    Pinboard.in experienced a bit of feature degradation as its admin replaced a disk. I’m only including this because it meant that I couldn’t post this issue on time. ;)
Pinboard‘s really awesome, and I wouldn’t be able to put together this newsletter without it. The API is super-simple to use, and I’m able to save and classify links right on my phone. A+, would socially bookmark with again.
