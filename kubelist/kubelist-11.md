#### kubelist issue 11 - KubeCon EU hype edition

> Welcome to a very special week before KubeCon EU edition of kubelist! The kubelist editors are very excited to see what new announcements come out of KubeCon, and to hear about what has the community frustrated and excited.

1. [Introducing the Vault Operator for Kubernetes](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-vault-operator-project)

    Operators are the kubelist editors' second favorite concept in Kubernetes, behind Custom Resource Definitions. The announcement of the Vault Operator had us quite excited, though we do hope that the native secrets of Kubernetes gain Vault's functionalities over time. Kubernetes is the API we want to write against.
1. [A developers stand point on Docker Swarm and Kubernetes](https://medium.com/@scottietom/a-developers-stand-point-on-docker-swarm-and-kubernetes-d23beb7b9075)

    Are you experiencing a sensitivity to indentation, confusion over when to quote strings, or anxiety in large files? If so, you may be suffering from a condition known as YAML fatigue.If you think you may be suffering from YAML fatigue, please consult your docker.
1. [Introducing Heptio Gimbal: Bridging cloud native and traditional infrastructure](https://blog.heptio.com/introducing-heptio-gimbal-bridging-cloud-native-and-traditional-infrastructure-9d6224bece5a)

    The kubelist editors have been investigating global scale load balancing solutions like Backplane  to help us migrate the legacy racks of DEC Alpha / Tru64 infrastructure (they run our "UNIX systems you're glad you don't have to use" mailing list) to Kubernetes. We're happy to see another alternative become available.At the risk of sounding too much like CIO.com: Envoy is eating the world.
1. [The Future of Kubernetes Is Serverless](https://thenewstack.io/the-future-of-kubernetes-is-serverless/)

    Our industry has equated "serverless" with "functions as a service" almost since AWS introduced lambda. Brendan Burns and others have pushed to define serverless at a container level rather than a function level. This article by Brendan on The New Stack is a good overview of this vision, and how it fits with Kubernetes. 
1. [Cilium 1.0: Bringing the BPF Revolution to Kubernetes Networking and Security](https://cilium.io/blog/2018/04/24/cilium-10/)

    BPF, used by Cilium in place of iptables, is a fascinating example of one of the many interpreters that run inside the Linux Kernel. We're glad that BPF has become so useful in the kernel and the larger ecosystem. We could have ended up with a more general purpose ACPI interpreter instead! Happy first birthday, Cilium, and great job on that goofy saw-bmarine cartoon!
1. [Tweet of the week](https://twitter.com/asynchio/status/988508906547691520)

    Joseph Jacks shares the Kubernetes Application Survey results and provides some commentary on the data. If you're building a product on top of Kubernetes, there's some lessons to be learned from the data here.The kubelist editors' favorite comment from the results: "EKS please..."
