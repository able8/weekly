## [Kubelist Issue #25 for 2018-08-02](https://kubelist.com/issue/25)

#### Rock your YAML right! RBAC's back alright! ðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ•º

> Welcome to a very special RBAC double-shot edition of kubelist. In addition to RBAC, we&#39;ve got bare metal networking, for those of you that avoid the cloud (or build your own!), and end to the vicious Kubernetes vs Docker debate (?), and cake! Yes, cake. Well, StatusCake; you can&#39;t eat it ðŸ˜¢.

1. [Demystifying RBAC in Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/08/01/demystifying-rbac-in-kubernetes/)

    The first of our RBAC content comes from Bitnami's Javier Salmeron in a post on the CNCF blog. This post includes a link to the video, where much of the content appears to come from. It's a great introduction to the concept of RBAC itself. After reading, assign the "rbac-user" role to yourself, which grants the "understand" verb on "rbac" resources.
1. [Kubernetes vs. Docker: Why not both?](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2018/07/30/kubernetes-docker-vs/)

    Here's a nice light post to send to the uninitiated to help them understand the difference between Kubernetes and Docker. After they've finished reading it, launch into a long explaination of the Open Container Initiative.
1. [Configuring permissions in Kubernetes with RBAC](https://medium.com/containerum/configuring-permissions-in-kubernetes-with-rbac-a456a9717d5d)

    RBAC post two this week comes from Nikita Mazur on the Containerum blog. This post is more focused on RBAC application more than theory, but has a definate advantage over the first post, as its examples are actual text that you can copy and paste, as one does to start all good Kubernetes manifests.
1. [Automating uptime monitoring on Kubernetes with Statuscake](https://medium.com/stakater/automating-uptime-monitoring-on-kubernetes-with-statuscake-dd203d2bac65)

    On the Stakater blog, a mysterious anonymous author introduces us to their Ingress Monitor Controller, and guides us through using it to set up uptime monitoring with StatusCake. The kubelist editors love projects like this, that move Kubernetes further down and out in the stack. It's hard to forget to configure uptime monitoring if it happens automatically in your cluster! Stakater has quite a few nice looking projects. We look forward to reading more of their content. 
1. [Kubernetes FAQ: How Can I Route Traffic for Kubernetes on Bare Metal?](https://dzone.com/articles/kubernetes-faq-how-can-i-route-traffic-for-kuberne)

    The kubelist music editor wasn't familiar with this particular sub-genre, and couldn't even find it on Wikipedia's list. A Metal Load Balancer does sound important to help distribute scorching riffs over an epic solo, however.
1. [Tweet of the Week](https://twitter.com/MaartjeME/status/1024192545751015424)

    We are also looking forward to pluggable secret storage backends.
