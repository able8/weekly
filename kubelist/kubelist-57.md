1. [Autoscaling for Kubernetes workloads](https://lwn.net/Articles/754153/)

    Antoine BeauprÃ© covers Frederic Branczyk dives into the future and the past of the Kubernetes autoscalers. The hope is standardization (engineers, duh) from interfaces to metrics to mechanisms.
1. [Kubernetes Add-ons for more Efficient Computing](https://akomljen.com/kubernetes-add-ons-for-more-efficient-computing/)

    ADDONS - several of these are autoscaling related and go in detail about the use cases for them. In particular, read about the addon resizer - a VPA for scaling apps that use more resources as your cluster grows.
