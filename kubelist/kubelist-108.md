## [Kubelist Issue #108 for 2020-11-11](https://kubelist.com/issue/108)

#### Linkerd (2.9!) ‚õì

> This week on the <a href="https://kubelist.com/podcast">Kubelist Podcast</a>, I had a conversation with William Morgan from <a href="https://buoyant.io/">Buoyant</a> about the <a href="http://linkerd.io/">Linkerd</a> project. The conversation ranged from the origins of Linkerd to some of the technical challenges of building it in Scala; and then Rust and Go. 

1. [Announcing Linkerd 2.9: mTLS for all, ARM support, and more!](https://linkerd.io/2020/11/09/announcing-linkerd-2.9/)

    This is a great place to start. This is a big release of Linkerd, full of features, but automatic mutual TLS for all traffic is (rightfully) the leading headline. Your microservices might not be sending data over HTTP, and now you‚Äôll get the benefits of mTLS over these non-HTTP connections without having to do anything extra. üö®
1. [Kubernetes Podcast: Linkerd, with Thomas Rampelberg](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/129-linkerd/)

    Thomas is one of the core maintainers of the Linkerd project, and one of the creators of DC/OS and the Service Mesh Interface. It‚Äôs awesome to hear him on the Kubernetes Podcast talking about Linkerd. Thomas talks about the origins of the service mesh as a platform and his views of why microservices and service meshes can help scale an organization, not just technology. üéô
1. [What‚Äôs New in Linkerd 2.9: mTLS for all TCP connections, ARM support, and more](https://www.cncf.io/webinars/whats-new-in-linkerd-2-9-mtls-for-all-tcp-connections-arm-support-and-more/)

    Coming up: Oliver Gould, CTO and cofounder at Buoyant, is presenting a CNCF webinar to discuss the Linkerd 2.9 release. If you‚Äôre reading this right after the newsletter is delivered, this webinar probably hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Good for you ‚Äì you can register and attend live! If you‚Äôre in a different time zone or catching up on the Kubelist newsletter in the evening, come back and watch the webinar.
1. [Dive: The Simplest Way To Understand Your Kubernetes Platform](https://dive.co)

    Dive is the SaaS offering from Buoyant to work on top of Linkerd. William discusses this project on the Kubelist podcast today, as well as the purpose behind it. Dive is a product designed to give you a view of how your cluster is operating, but it‚Äôs not just another Kubernetes dashboard showing you which pods are crashing and where they are running. Sign up, join the waitlist, and try it out. ü§ø
1. [The Meshifesto](https://buoyant.io/service-mesh-manifesto/)

    ‚ÄúWhat every software engineer needs to know about the world‚Äôs more over-hyped technology‚Äù. This is an amazing write-up that explains what a service mesh is, using clear and concise terms. The service mesh is definitely hyped a lot in the Kubernetes ecosystem, but for good reason. A service mesh can solve problems at a platform level, which is generally better than solving these problems at the application level. Don‚Äôt go and adopt a service mesh because your friends did, but read this and see if any of the problems resonate. üï∏Ô∏è
1. [Introduction to Service Mesh with Linkerd](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-service-mesh-with-linkerd)

    Written for Linkerd 2.9 (the newest release), and led by Charles Pretzer (a Buoyant Field Engineer), this promises to be a great course to get your hands on service meshes and Linkerd. If you have a problem that you think Linkerd can solve, sign up and get learning. üìö
