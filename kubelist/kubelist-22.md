## [Kubelist Issue #22 for 2018-07-12](https://kubelist.com/issue/22)

#### the post-apocalyptic theme park issue

> Welcome to a very special post-apocalyptic theme park issue of kubelist! This week, we&#39;ve got high octane tweets, high rev tooling, a theme park, and a migration story with more rises and drops than the roller coaster you rode at this year&#39;s KubeCon EU party! Please keep your hands and feet inside the newsletter at all times.

1. [Kubernetes explained in pictures: the theme park analogy](https://danlebrero.com/2018/07/09/kubernetes-explained-in-pictures-the-theme-park-analogy/)

    The kubelist chief editor of "wheeeeee!" brought Daniel Lebrero's post into the bullpen. With analogies for nodes and resource requirements, this post is one of the more complete introduction analogies, while still being digestible. Share it with the kids in your life to get them more excited about what you do during the day.
1. [7 best practices for building containers](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/07/7-best-practices-for-building-containers.html)

    On the Google Cloud Platform Blog, Théo Chamley is seven out of seven for great tips. For example, did you know you probably don't want your RUN command at the end of your Dockerfile? It's like reverse Polish notation but for build tooling. A quick recommended read for container beginners and veterans alike.
1. [Introducing Dev Spaces for AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-dev-spaces-for-aks/)

    Microsoft has done some great things for making Kubernetes more approachable. For instance, The Kubernetes Visual Studio Code integration makes many aspects of a cluster discoverable and inspectable by anyone. Dev Spaces seem to go down the same path, offering push-button developer setups. The kubelist editors hope that most of the technology for this will be Open Source, and applicable to clusters other than those in AKS.
1. [Migrating Netlify’s Continuous Deployment infra to Kubernetes (and everything we learned along the way)](https://medium.com/@calavera/migrating-netlifys-continuous-deployment-infra-to-kubernetes-and-everything-we-learned-along-the-1e5989254269)

    David Calavera provides a breakdown of Netlify's build tooling, and how it has evolved to handle scale, not unlike a Pokémon. David outlines the challenges and successes they've had, both before and after the move to Kubernetes. This post is worth a read for any trainer looking to prepare their cluster for the next gym battle.
1. [Moving the needle on kubeadm in Kubernetes 1.11](https://blog.heptio.com/moving-the-needle-on-kubeadm-in-kubernetes-1-11-90a87ddb9d0f)

    On the Heptio blog, Eryn Muetzel provides an overview of what kubeadm is, where it's going, and how it will fit into a grander vision for cluster creation and maintenance. The included diagram is particularly useful for understanding where kubeadm fits, and why extra tooling is still needed.
1. [Tweet of the Week](https://twitter.com/jta/status/1017211190668218368)

    The kubelist editors can't tell if this is supposed to represent a torrent of deploys as your controller reconciles existing pods, or the ramshackle nature of your pods with all their sidecars. Either way, we can't say no to Mad Max.
