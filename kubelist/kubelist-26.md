## [Kubelist Issue #26 for 2018-08-09](https://kubelist.com/issue/26)

#### The dark secret lurking within every Target store ðŸŽ¯

> This issue is very special, like all the others. This week we learn the dark and terrible secret hiding within every Target store (it&#39;s stateful applications!). If you look closely within one of the other posts, you&#39;ll find details of a similar setup for Chick-fil-A, too! It&#39;s a treasure hunt for your mind and eyeballs!

1. [Multi-cluster Kubernetes load balancing in AWS with Yggdrasil](https://medium.com/uswitch-labs/multi-cluster-kubernetes-load-balancing-in-aws-with-yggdrasil-c1583ea7d78f)

    Envoy keeps popping up! In his post on the uSwitch blog, Joseph Irving introduces Yggdrasil. It seems quite similar to Heptio Gimbal, which is curiously not mentioned (though Contour is). It seems likely that they were being developed at the same time. Envoy's subscription-based configuration seems incredibly powerful; we'd like to see more applications adopt this style.
1. [Kubernetes as a Cloud-Native Operating System: â€“ On-Premises, Too!](https://dzone.com/articles/kubernetes-as-a-cloud-native-operating-system-on-p)

    On DZone, Roopak Parikh provides an overview and analysis of the not-so-distant future, where Kubernetes is the base layer for applications deployed everywhere from the public cloud to the closet in the back of a fast food joint. It seems clear that Kubernetes will replace Linux as the ubiquitous touch-point for development. See kubelist issue #21 for musings on how this will apply to cars.
1. [Running Cassandra in Kubernetes Across 1,800 Stores](https://tech.target.com/2018/08/08/running-cassandra-in-kubernetes-across-1800-stores.html)

    Car Salesman: Slaps roof of big-box retail chain This bad boy can fit so many SSTables in it
1. [What is Kubernetes?](http://www.itpro.co.uk/enterprise-applications/31654/what-is-kubernetes)

    The kubelist editors like to include a Kubernetes introduction post every so often, for our readers to keep in their back pocket to pass to management when they need budget for a shiny new cluster. This post by Dale Walker is quite good, particularly for its glossary. Dale deserves extra credit for mentioning the Open Container Initiative.
1. [Horrors of using Azure Kubernetes Service in production](https://movingfulcrum.com/horrors-of-using-azure-kubernetes-service-in-production/)

    Finally we have a Kubernetes based retelling of Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. The kubelist editors are sympathetic both to Prashant and those working at Microsoft trying to help.
1. [Tweet of the Week](https://twitter.com/anthonypjshaw/status/1027370452535009280)

    If anyone figures out that last hard problem, please let us know.
