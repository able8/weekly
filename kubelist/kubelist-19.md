#### the summer binge watching edition ðŸ“º

> Welcome to a very special first day of summer binge watching edition of kubelist!

1. [Kubernetes Best Practicesâ€Šâ€”â€ŠSeason One](https://medium.com/google-cloud/kubernetes-best-practices-season-one-11119aee1d10)

    On the "Google Cloud Platform - Community" blog, Sandeep Dinesh provides a spoiler-free recap of the first season of Sandeep Dinesh's hit YouTube show, "Kubernetes Best Practices". Some outlets have argued that "Kubernetes Best Practices" is derivative of "Game of Thrones", arguing that namespaces are simply houses, and pod termination echo's George R. R. Martin's taste for killing off characters (and isn't he wearing a sailor's cap?). We still feel the first season is worth watching.
1. [Welcome to Fedora CoreOS](https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-coreos/)

    The future of CoreOS Container Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host aren't clear, after Red Hat bought CoreOS. The kubelist editors know that this future will be decided in the open, in Fedora, and appreciate this post by Matthew Miller for its honesty about the details not existing yet. The kubelist editors are also more than happy to let someone else worry about operating system packaging, and instead focus on the higher level abstractions that Kubernetes gives them.
1. [ The History of Kubernetes on a Timeline](https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-kubernetes/)

    New! Kubernetes on a Timeline! The cool summer treat, that's easy and fun to eat! Grab one today from your local grocer's freezer aisle -- hmm, what? oh, that's Kubernetes on a Stick. This post's interactive timeline is still pretty great.
1. [Scaling Kubernetes for 25M users](https://medium.com/@brendanrius/scaling-kubernetes-for-25m-users-a7937e3536a0)

    25 million users may be a distant aspiration for you; how about 600 pods, instead? In this post, Brendan Rius outlines some good tips for getting your infrastructure ready for when you begin to reach the limits of your existing node's capacities.
1. [Rackspace Launches Industryâ€™s First Pay-As-You-Go Kubernetes Private Cloud](https://blog.rackspace.com/uk/rackspace-pay-as-you-go-kubernetes-private-cloud)

    The kubelist editors will be the first to admit they are not the target audience for this blog post. Perhaps you are? Either way, more options for managed Kubernetes are always welcome.
1. [Tweet of the week](https://twitter.com/ipedrazas/status/1009509224249020419)

    Container orchestration has never been sweeter. Be sure to read the full thread!
