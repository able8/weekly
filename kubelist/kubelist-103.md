## [Kubelist Issue #103 for 2020-10-07](https://kubelist.com/issue/103)

#### GitOps with Argo CD üîÑ

> This week, we‚Äôre taking a closer look at GitOps and the Argo project. <a href="https://twitter.com/mukulikak">Mukulika Kapas</a> from Intuit joined the <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/the-kubelist-podcast/ep-2-workflow-engines-with-mukulika-kapas-of-intuit/">Kubelist podcast</a> this week to discuss <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo</a> and GitOps. Argo came out of a need at Intuit to manage clusters at scale. While the Argo project consists of four subprojects (Argo CD, Workflows, Events and Rollouts) the topic of this newsletter is GitOps, so we are focusing on the Argo CD subproject.

1. [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)

    Argo CD is the original subproject from the Argo project and one of the CNCF GitOps tools. Argo is a modular and flexible implementation of GitOps designed to be compatible with your infrastructure. For more information about Argo, check out the conversation on this week‚Äôs Kubelist podcast. üéô
1. [30+ Tool list for GitOps](https://blog.cherre.com/2020/09/14/30+-tools-list-for-gitops/)

    Here is a comprehensive list of tools that you can use to build your GitOps pipeline from @stefanthorpe. Don‚Äôt try to use them all, but this is a great collection you can reference when designing your workflow and thinking through how to solve certain problems. Chances are there‚Äôs something on this list to help with any problem or challenge you run into while setting up GitOps. üî®
1. [GitOps: The Bad and the Ugly](https://blog.container-solutions.com/gitops-the-bad-and-the-ugly)

    Depending on how you‚Äôre managing continuous delivery before moving to a GitOps workflow, there might be some challenges that a new tool won‚Äôt overcome. This is an interesting post that attempts to detail some of the challenges you will certainly encounter when adopting GitOps. Most of these are solvable though ‚Äì there are solutions for managing secrets and for running pre-deploy checks. Don‚Äôt read this and think these are deal-breakers or limitations of GitOps; but instead look at this as the obstacles you will hit, and then look at some of the other links today for solutions. üí©
1. [GitOps Conversation Kit](https://gitops-community.github.io/kit/)

    Thanks to the team at Weaveworks for donating this kit to the community. This is an amazing resource to read and prepare anyone or any team on a journey to GitOps. What makes this ‚Äúconversation kit‚Äù an invaluable resource is its focus on the value and methodologies of GitOps without showing an opinionated toolchain. If you want to arm yourself with information to use when trying to convince your team to adopt GitOps, there is no better resource than the GitOps Conversation Kit. üí¨
1. [GitOps Days 2020 Talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9lTuCFNLaD2NiNrdt7SaQjpYx_m37czS)

    The above mentioned GitOps Conversation Kit came out of the incredible GitOps Days event, put on by Weaveworks. There are talks from folks who have adopted GitOps using various tools, and great lessons to be learned from them. Whether you have a GitOps workflow already, or are thinking about starting, queue these talks if you are passionate about the idea! üé¨
1. [Is GitOps the next big thing in automation?](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/07/14/gitops-next-big-thing-automation/)

    The folks at GitLab conducted a Twitter survey showing that a surprising 23.8% of respondents use GitOps today. GitLab is seeing the GitOps methodology and building for it. They‚Äôve recently released the GitLab Kubernetes Agent, which is a Kubernetes implementation of a pull-based GitOps workflow, on top of the Argo CD engine. This week‚Äôs Kubelist podcast mentions the work and how GitLab used the engine. ‚ö°
