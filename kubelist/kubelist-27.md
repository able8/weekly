## [Kubelist Issue #27 for 2018-08-16](https://kubelist.com/issue/27)

#### A peek behind the curtain 

> Welcome to a truely special issue 27 of kubelist! This week, we get meaty with networking, pentest our own cluster, and try and understand why this blockchain thing needs servers. Plus, we peek behind the curtain, and reveal a bit more about the kubelist mythos.

1. [Kube-hunter - an open source tool for Kubernetes penetration testing](https://blog.aquasec.com/kube-hunter-kubernetes-penetration-testing)

    On the Aquasec blog, Liz Rice introduces Kube-hunter, a new tool and service to scan for issues with your Kubernetes cluster. The kubelist security editor decided to run Kube-hunter and is all smug about it finding no results, because our cluster sits in a VPC. Surely that means kubelist is unhackable.
1. [Kubernetes Networking: How to Write Your Own CNI Plug-in with Bash](https://www.altoros.com/blog/kubernetes-networking-writing-your-own-simple-cni-plug-in-with-bash/)

    On the Altoros blog, Siarhei Matsiukevich introduces the Container Network Interface (CNI), and walks you through creating and using a CNI plug-in. In bash. We hope you're hungry, because this post is meaty üçñ!
1. [Keep your cluster secrets up to date with Manifold + Kubernetes](https://blog.manifold.co/keep-your-cluster-secrets-up-to-date-with-manifold-kubernetes-8d483fd4cc1)

    Disclaimer: the kubelist editors are employees of Manifold.We wanted to share this post with you because we like this integration and use it for Manifold. It's a simple way to get credentials for external services like logging platforms, or custom configuration into native Kubernetes secrets, and keep the values in sync.We hope you're not mad at us for shilling.
We're sure to do it again, but we'll always tell you when we do ü§ó.
1. [DApp Infrastructure Design (Part I): Reliable Ethereum Event Tracking with Kubernetes, Docker, and Parity](https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-dapp-infrastructure-2b4f1e6bfa38)

    It turns out that DApps actually run on Kubernetes, just like serverless.
1. [Spinnaker 1.9 Release Announcement](https://blog.spinnaker.io/spinnaker-1-9-release-announcement-82dd549442e6)

    Scott Seaward introduces Spinnaker 1.9 on the Spinnaker Community blog. Spinnaker, the multi-cloud multi-everything continuous delivery platform, seems like it will either one day become indispensable for large Kubernetes deployments, or be obsoleted by multi-cluster capabilities in Kubernetes itself. Until then, the Kubernetes enhancements in 1.9 sound quite nice; we look forward to trying it out, and perhaps relieving some of the guilt we feel for using Jenkins in too many places.
1. [Tweet of the Week](https://twitter.com/william_hearn/status/1030058767713542144)

    Oh my gosh, delicious Kubernetes cupcakes! üá®üá¶Ottawa is doing meet-ups right.
