## [Kubelist Issue #8 for 2018-04-05](https://kubelist.com/issue/8)

#### Issue #8's subject line is still being trained in our ML cluster

> Welcome to a very special makeover edition of kubelist! This week, we&#39;ve got our own brand-new logo! We probably won&#39;t change it again next week. Probably.

1. [How Booking.com Uses Kubernetes for Machine Learning](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/04/booking-kubernetes-machine-learn)

    By controlling our leisure time, the machines will keep us content and docile. Their beginning strategy is to subtly influence our date and destination selection for vacations. Educate yourself about this threat on InfoQ, where they reveal the faustian bargain Booking.com has made with the machines.
1. [Draft vs Gitkube vs Helm vs Ksonnet vs Metaparticle vs Skaffold](https://blog.hasura.io/draft-vs-gitkube-vs-helm-vs-ksonnet-vs-metaparticle-vs-skaffold-f5aa9561f948)

    Shahidh K Muhammed presents a complete overview of the tools that help you develop and deploy applications on Kubernetes. The included architecture diagrams are a nice touch. Note that Hasura is the creator of Gitkube The kubelist editors do not detect any bias in this article, however.See also Heptio's TGI Kubernetes YouTube series, which is in the middle of covering these tools.
1. [Comparing Kubernetes Authentication Methods](https://medium.com/@etienne_24233/comparing-kubernetes-authentication-methods-6f538d834ca7)

    It can be easy to confuse authentication with authorization. Authentication is when the machines scan your retina to determine that you are you. Authorization is when, after knowing who you are, the machines decide if you are permitted to enter the neodymium mines.
1. [Building stuff with the Kubernetes API (Part 4)â€Šâ€”â€ŠUsing Go](https://medium.com/programming-kubernetes/building-stuff-with-the-kubernetes-api-part-4-using-go-b1d0e3c1c899)

    Part four in Vladimir Vivien's series covers using client-go to interact with the Kubernetes API. The Kubelist editors love seeing how similar things are done in different languages, as this series does. We only wish we had seen it sooner!
1. [Writing Kubernetes Custom Controllers](https://medium.com/@cloudark/kubernetes-custom-controllers-b6c7d0668fdf)

    We humans will soon battle with the machines for control of our future. This article won't help us there, but it is a great overview of the components involved in a custom Kubernetes controller. The kubelist editors will think back fondly on the included control flow diagram, as the machines dish out their nutrient slurry.
1. [Tweet of the week](https://twitter.com/ogrisel/status/981804922000822272)

    Half slide deck, half cookbook for letting the machines into your cluster, this presentation is getting a lot of love on twitter today! Choice quote: "Kubernetes as the computational substrate for data science" ðŸ¤–
