## [Kubelist Issue #45 for 2018-12-20](https://kubelist.com/issue/45)

#### Happy Kubernetes Holidays Edition ☸️

> You’re at home now for the holidays, all filled up from your trip to Kubecon.
You’re quietly drinking eggnog and coffee mixed together contemplating what open source project you are going to work on for the next 12 days… a new controller to do that deployment thing you do 5 times a day, or perhaps contributing to the horizontal pod autoscaler? So many choices. Why don’t you take a break from your open source holiday anxiety and have a little read. We’ve got everything from AI to video games to an interview on the state of the Kube.

    Kubernetes is quickly becoming a great tool for AI. Since we've been able to deploy jobs-type workloads on GPU container runtimes, several ML training and workload solutions have come out. At their core they tend to leverage kubernetes in the same way; Shashank Prasanna explains how.
