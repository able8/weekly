## [Kubelist Issue #110 for 2020-12-02](https://kubelist.com/issue/110)

#### Keptn

> This week on the <a href="https://kubelist.com/podcast">Kubelist Podcast</a>, I had a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/grabnerandi">Andreas Grabner</a> from Dynatrace about the <a href="https://keptn.sh">Keptn</a> project. Keptn is a CNCF Sandbox project to orchestrate event-driven workflows, often for CI/CD tasks. In this issue, weâ€™re sending some links to Keptn resources and a few other great podcast episodes from the PurePerformance podcast.

1. [Keptn â€“ The Autonomous Cloud control plane for Dynatrace explained](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/keptn-the-autonomous-cloud-control-plane-for-dynatrace-explained/)

    If youâ€™re just getting started with Keptn, this post does a good job explaining the Keptn project. Here, Andreas walks through the project, and then guides you through installation and a couple of use cases. Keptn is built on a concept called Quality Gates, and these are explained in detail in this blog post. ðŸ¤”
1. [What is Keptn, how it works, and how to get started!](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/what-is-keptn-how-it-works-and-how-to-get-started/)

    If youâ€™re looking for more to understand Keptn, this post describes use cases and how to get started with it. Itâ€™s important to understand that Keptn is not another CD tool, but instead, it can orchestrate workflows (with a focus on CD). This blog post from Dynatrace also includes a description of the Keptn architecture, which is very useful if youâ€™re thinking about how to extend it to work with your own processes.
1. [Implementing SLI/SLO based Continuous Delivery Quality Gates using Prometheus](https://medium.com/keptn/implementing-sli-slo-based-continuous-delivery-quality-gates-using-prometheus-9e17ec18ca36)

    From the Keptn blog, this is a walk through showing how to set up Keptn quality gates that get data from Prometheus. Since most of us are running Prometheus in our Kubernetes clusters, this guide is probably compatible with your cluster today. ðŸšª
1. [Automate service delivery with Keptn, Atlassian, and Dynatrace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUDaKV-iR2g)

    Hereâ€™s a great video presentation with both Atlassian and Dynatrace showing how Keptn can be used to create a more reliable CD workflow. This talk is an hour long, but itâ€™s worth it. Automated service delivery is more than CD; and this talk explains how to get confidence by building quality gates and checks to provide more reliability in autonomous operations. âš¡
1. [How to scale k8s operations from a single to thousands of clusters](https://www.spreaker.com/user/pureperformance/how-to-scale-k8s-operations-from-a-singl)

    From the PurePerformance podcast, this is a fun episode talking about moving from a single cluster to multi-cluster, at scale. Once youâ€™ve solved the challenges of operating a single Kubernetes cluster, the next step is to figure out how to run multiple clusters.
1. [A Minimalistic Approach to Kubernetes with Kelsey Hightower](https://www.spreaker.com/user/pureperformance/a-minimalistic-approach-to-kubernetes-wi)

    Itâ€™s always good to listen to Kelsey talk about Kubernetes. I really enjoyed the conversation and thoughts around developer productivity when running Kubernetes. The episode covers a lot of topics, but is really a good listen to see how other experts are thinking about some of the same problems you are likely dealing with. ðŸŽ™
1. [Tweet of the week](https://twitter.com/thockin/status/1333892204490735617)

    This is a real security problem, and there are some great thoughts from folks here. ðŸ”’
