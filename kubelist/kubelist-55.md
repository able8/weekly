## [Kubelist Issue #55 for 2019-03-07](https://kubelist.com/issue/55)

#### Dear Kubernetes….

> Kubernetes, you want to know what’s cool about you?

1. [Murder On The Kubernetes Express: The Life And Death Of A Docker Container](https://itnext.io/murder-on-the-kubernetes-express-the-life-and-death-of-a-docker-container-d7aec13f8188)

    Starting as a love letter to Kubernetes (and container murder?) the Project Aetos team releases a mobile interface for Prometheus. Well done and useful!
1. [Surviving a sudden spike in website traffic — Global rate limiting with Ambassador on Kubernetes](https://itnext.io/surviving-a-sudden-spike-in-website-traffic-global-rate-limiting-with-ambassador-a19dd2dfda46)

    Oh cool, rate limiting as a Kubernetes object with ambassador! 
1. [Run Terraform under Kubernetes using an Operator (CRD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraform/comments/axp3tv/run_terraform_under_kubernetes_using_an_operator/)

    Want to use Kubernetes to run terraform? How exciting is that? Very!
1. [Does anyone actually build a Kubernetes cluster from scratch?](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/awylad/does_anyone_actually_build_a_kubernetes_cluster/)

    There are many ways to build a Kubernetes cluster. Read this great thread to find out how people have done it from scratch.
1. [OperatorHub](https://www.operatorhub.io/)

    Super excited about this registry. Their “capability level” categories are a compelling way to think about operators. If you're not into operators yet checkout their overview: https://www.operatorhub.io/what-is-an-operator
1. [Krontab](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/krontab)

    A cron-like interface for Kubernetes jobs. Krontab works by constructing a virtual crontab file from your CronJob resources and communicating changes back to the Kubernetes API. This is going to be fun.
1. [Ocular](https://github.com/polyaxon/ocular/)

    Cool little python pod status lib for observing Kubernetes pods' statuses in real-time. Get your pod status piping hot.
1. [Tweet of the Week](https://twitter.com/try_except_/status/1103427313922920448)

    YES! YES! YES! More operators in more languages!
