1. [Four years after its release, Kubernetes has come a long way](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/06/four-years-after-release-of-kubernetes-1-0-it-has-come-long-way/)

    Four years ago, you were running Mesos and enabling individual cgroups features by hand to isolate your big tarball of ruby. How the world has changed! Take a walk down memory lane with this TechCrunch article. For more reminiscing, check out Joe Beda's post on the Kubernetes blog.
1. [Deploying to Google Kubernetes Engine](https://codeascraft.com/2018/06/05/deploying-to-google-kubernetes-engine/)

    This post by Toria Gibbs on the always excellent Etsy blog details their transition from premises Kubernetes to Google Kubernetes Engine. If you needed any indication that Kubernetes is being commoditized, look no further than this post, where even Etsy, the purveyors of the finest bespoke artisanal cat costumes have moved to a managed Kubernetes control plane.
1. [Getting started with Docker and Kubernetes on Windows 10](https://itnext.io/getting-started-with-docker-and-kubernetes-on-windows-10-39c93b7fe5c8)

    On ITNext, Keith Mifsud provides a tutorial for using Kubernetes on Windows 10. With Chocolatey and a decent command line, Windows development looks like it has come a long way since kubelist's recovering enterprise developer toiled in the Java mines. For a fun game, replace "Windows 10" in this article with "Candybar Linux" and see if any of your coworkers catch on.
The kubelist editors applaud Keith for including a BSOD in his post. üëèüëè
1. [Amazon EKS ‚Äì Now Generally Available](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eks-now-generally-available/)

    Your friend and ours Jeff Barr introduces us to EKS on the AWS Blog. The kubelist editors are excited to finally kick the tires on EKS, as they never got into the beta üòø(DigitalOcean, give us a call üòâ).
1. [How to Manage Access to 3rd Party Resources in Kubernetes with Helm](https://www.talend.com/blog/2018/06/06/how-to-manage-access-to-3rd-party-resources-in-kubernetes-with-helm/)

    S√©bastien Gandon and Iosif Igna outline how they handle using Postgres under multiple architectural configurations with Kubernetes and Helm, from development to production. The authors explain their problem (with diagrams!), describe how they fixed it, and link to a GitHub repo with Helm charts. You couldn't ask for more.
