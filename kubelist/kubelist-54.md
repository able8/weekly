## [Kubelist Issue #54 for 2019-02-28](https://kubelist.com/issue/54)

#### Smarter, Cheaper, Lighter, Stronger?

> As Kubernetes matures more cost savings and optimization endeavors are popping up – and this will only grow with wider K8s adoption. Specifically in this issue we have K3s.io and KubeADM-AWS; in addition to some general K8s knowledge and a neat little kubectl plugin by the name of rakess. I welcome you to dive in and enjoy!

1. [K3s.io ultralight K8s, designed with ARM in mind](https://k3s.io)

    It’s like regular K8s with 5 fewer things… and then 5 more. But it should still make things easier on your Pi clusters, where the real K8s work happens.
1. [KubeADM-AWS - Budget K8s cluster on AWS](https://github.com/cablespaghetti/kubeadm-aws)

    Ever wanted to run K8s on AWS for $3-6 a month? Now you can with this handy config; whether it will handle your workload is another question entirely.
1. [K8s namespaces with docker enterprise](https://blog.capstonec.com/2019/02/25/dev-test-and-prod-k8s-namespaces-in-docker-ee/)

    Not just specific to docker enterprise, and probably a good thing to read about if you’re not yet familiar with namespaces; they’re a great way to shake things up at the office and force your co-workers to beg you for access.
