1. [You got your VM in my container](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/you-got-your-vm-my-container)

    15 years ago, you did the impossible, and successfully virtualized your company's custom ERP system. Finally you could sunset that Pentium II box under Todd's desk, and move your new Windows 98 based VM to the cloud. You avoided immutable images by arguing that Windows 98 doesn't get any more updates anyways, and called in sick for all the meetings about Docker. Now, Kubernetes is in your organization, and you're out of sick days for the year.Don't worry! With KubeVirt you can manage VMs in Kubernetes, and not change a thing about your ERP VM. Todd won't be getting his Windows 98 license key back for at least another 15 years.

1. [Tweet of the week](https://twitter.com/asynchio/status/971109168273702912)

    Joseph Jacks distills a sentiment found within many blog posts and talks on Kubernetes. He did just announce his move to a company that wants to make money by selling a product on top of Kubernetes, so maybe he's thinking about the topic more than usual. Congratulations on your new position, Joseph!
