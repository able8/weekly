#### New logo, who dis? ðŸ™ˆ

> Welcome to a very special makeover edition of  kubelist! This week, we&#39;ve got our own brand-new logo! Yes, we&#39;re aware of how many spokes it has :)

1. [Kubernetes 1.10: an insider take on what's new](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/03/Kubernetes-1-10-an-insider-take-on-whats-new.html)

    With the release of Kubernetes 1.10, there's no shortage of news about it. You've probably read about it 7 times already over on TechnoCrackle and CIO Club.This post by Craig Box is one of our favorites. It's not too long, and has the right amount of meaty technical info (like 95%). Goldilocks is an SRE, and this is her Kubernetes 1.10 post of choice.
1. [Studying the Kubernetes Ingress system](https://www.joyfulbikeshedding.com/blog/2018-03-26-studying-the-kubernetes-ingress-system.html)

    On his blog, Hongli Lai dissects the Kubernetes Ingress system, with the NGINX ingress as his primary subject. As the original author of passenger, he's certainly got the background for this!We love his closing statement:On the one hand I'm disappointed that there are no more interesting things, on the other hand I'm relieved because "more interesting" means "more complex".
1. [Introducing Click: The Command Line Interactive Controller for Kubernetes](https://databricks.com/blog/2018/03/27/introducing-click-the-command-line-interactive-controller-for-kubernetes.html)

    Deep in your heart of hearts - that secret place you expose to very few - you always wanted to be Lord Nikon, Acid Burn, or The Phantom Phreak. You would live within a land of terminals, ascii art skulls, and bootleg Cookie Monster art.Click is the doorway back into that world. Install rust, put on some Crystal Method, and enjoy this special-purpose Kubernetes REPL.
1. [Forget AWS Lambda, so long Kubernetes â€“ this is the future of serverless](https://diginomica.com/2018/03/23/aws-lambda-kubernetes-future-serverless)

    Do you ever read comments on articles? No, neither do we. But read the ones on this article. Sure, there is some anger, but there's a lot of insight in the handful of comments.Come for the inflammatory headline, stay for the comments.
1. [Thousands of etcd installs are leaking secret server keys online](http://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-etcd-server-installs-are-leaking-credentials/)

    The kubelist editorial staff has been split on using "Is etcd the next MongoDB of RansomWare targets?" or "Is etcd the next hacker playground after IoT?"Keep your data safe, everyone!
1. [Tweet of the week](https://twitter.com/ipedrazas/status/979293422199738368)

    The kubelist editors have not tried SSL, Istio, and Kubernetes together, but we do love a good horror story, and learned fairly quickly to keep that Kerberos login, but not mount our home directory over NFS.
