1. [Proposing an enhancement to Kubernetes: The story of a KEP ](https://medium.com/uswitch-labs/proposing-an-enhancement-to-kubernetes-the-story-of-a-kep-f652656d0628)

    Imagine having a rare use case, currently unsupported by a widely used system, requiring a large scale change. Proposing such an enhancement can feel like shouting into the wind! Kubernetes has a process called KEP for proposing larger changes that need to involve more people. Here we follow Joseph Irving in his struggle to get support for his proposal, and benefit from many of his learnings along the way.
1. [Why Is Storage On Kubernetes So Hard? ](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/01/11/why-is-storage-on-kubernetes-is-so-hard/)

    The ephemeral nature of containers is central to the ability to deploy anywhere and scale effectively. This, however, runs counter to the stateful nature of persistent data storage, because application data needs to remain intact as containers are created and destroyed. This article examines the challenges inherent in this divergence, and presents several solutions currently used in production applications for both native and non-native Kubernetes environments.

    As developers setting up new projects, we like to go with what we know. But our classic favorites don’t always age like a fine wine or a good cheese. Liran Haimovitch of Rookout gives us four compelling reasons why choosing Traefik might fit much better as a Kubernetess Ingress than Nginx does.
