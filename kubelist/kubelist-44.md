## [Kubelist Issue #44 for 2018-12-13](https://kubelist.com/issue/44)

#### The KubeCon Announcements Edition

> It&#39;s announcement season in the Kubernetes world, as KubeCon is the perfect time for companies to show off and gain exposure. We take a look at a number of things that caught our eye this week, while our secret agents were walking around the conference floor leaving Kubelist sticker trails behind them.

1. [Red Hat contributes etcd, the cornerstone of Kubernetes, to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-contributes-etcd-cornerstone-kubernetes-cloud-native-computing-foundation)

    Etcd is at the core of Kubernetes. It‚Äôs the data layer which enables Kubernetes to operate in a distributed manner. At KubeCon, Red Hat announced that it has contributed etcd to the CNCF. This ensures a vendor neutral drive of etcd, but also brings etcd closer to the community which benefits from it the most.
1. [Announcing GitLab Serverless ](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/12/11/introducing-gitlab-serverless/)

    I‚Äôll take the high road and you take the low road but either way it leads to compute. Serverless helps offset the cost-benefit equation for enterprise, so it's really no surprise that GitLab is jumping on the bandwagon. 
1. [Achieve workload compliance and scale-to-zero with new Kubernetes open source projects ](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2018/12/11/announcing-kubernetes-open-source-projects-osiris-kubernetes-policy-controller/)

    During last year‚Äôs Kubecon, Microsoft introduced Virtual Kubelet to the community. Now they‚Äôve announced the follow up on this, Osiris. Osiris helps with scaling applications to zero based on the demand and thus lowering infrastructure cost. Besides Osiris, Microsoft has also open sourced their Kubernetes Policy Controller. This helps with validating specific configuration rules set up by organisations.
1. [Oracle shows up at KubeCon bearing ‚Äòcomprehensive cloud native framework‚Äô](https://devclass.com/2018/12/11/oracle-at-kubecon-comprehensive-cloud-native-framework/)

    Have you ever fell victim to vendor lock-in? Oracle aims to combat this common issue with what they claim to be the ‚Äúmost comprehensive cloud native framework‚Äù. But hasn‚Äôt their strategy to date been just the opposite? ü§î
1. [Re-Imagining Virtualization with Kubernetes and KubeVirt](https://blog.openshift.com/re-imagining-virtualization-with-kubernetes-and-kubevirt/)

    It‚Äôs a Kubernetes world, we‚Äôre just living in it. KubeVirt aims to re-imagine virtualization with K8s top of mind, allowing you to run and manage both application containers and virtual machines, on the same cluster and same node. 
1. [KubeCon-CloudNativeCon-North-America-2018's slides](https://github.com/warmchang/KubeCon-North-America-2018)

    Whether you made it to KubeCon this week or not, this central repo of KubeCon slides has everything you‚Äôre looking for üòç(Look hard enough and you might find some slides from our contributors).
