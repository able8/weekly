## [Kubelist Issue #41 for 2018-11-22](https://kubelist.com/issue/41)

#### The thankful for K8s edition

> There are many reasons to be thankful for kubernetes, but for the purposes of today&#39;s issue, we’ve narrowed it down to 6 reasons why we love this container-orchestration system 🙏

1. [Cross Cloud Kubernetes](https://blog.turtlesystems.co.uk/2018/11/20/Cross-Cloud-Kubernetes/)

    From Docker Swarm to Kubernetes, from one Kubernetes cluster to a multi-cloud configuration. Russel Seymour takes us on a journey which sheds a light on how you can configure your Kubernetes cluster across multiple cloud providers.
1. [Getting started with Kubernetes: 5 misunderstandings, explained](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2018/11/getting-started-kubernetes-5-misunderstandings-explained)

    With Kuberentes' rapid development cycle and ever growing feature list, it’s easy to get lost. In this post, Kevin Casey does a great job of explaining some common misunderstandings about Kubernetes. Spoiler alert: it’s not always that easy!
1. [Kubernetes Container Runtimes](https://kubedex.com/kubernetes-container-runtimes/)

    As you know, a container runtime runs your containers 😅
Most people are used to the docker runtime but with security and performance on the line, the days of the docker engine as the default container of kubernetes may soon be over.
1. [Grafana templating with Prometheus labels](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/grafana-templating/)

    A cluster without monitoring isn’t really a cluster, is it? Kubernetes and Prometheus go hand in hand and so do Prometheus and Grafana. Ferenc Hernadi and Sandor Guba give us great insight as to how we can use Prometheus Labels to make dynamic Grafana Dashboards.
1. [As We May Kube*](https://medium.com/@mhausenblas/as-we-may-kube-293b30c0a365)

    Kubernetes has made a big impact on the ops community, but it has not yet reached full momentum with developers. Michael Hausenblas goes over why this might be the case, and what we could potentially do to improve the Developer Experience.
1. [Tweet of the Week](https://twitter.com/ultimateboy/status/1065092341055123456)

    We wonder how many variations of this have been written over the years. It’s definitely better than piping a pasted secret into base64 decode.
