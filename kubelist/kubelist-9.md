## [Kubelist Issue #9 for 2018-04-12](https://kubelist.com/issue/9)

#### Issue 9 - Our most comfortable issue yet

> Welcome to a very special nothing-has-changed edition of kubelist! This week, the kubelist editors continue to get comfortable with their new logo, snuggling into it like that old sweater you save for weekends around the house.

1. [We are Kubernetes Developers, Ask Us Anything!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/8b7f0x/we_are_kubernetes_developers_ask_us_anything/)

    A selection of everyone's favorite Kubernetes developers ran a Reddit AMA this week. This AMA is huge. Think of finding the good questions/answers as a treasure hunt. Here is the kubelist editor's favorite one to get you started. Happy hunting!
1. [Kubernetes Custom Resources Grow Up in v1.10](https://blog.openshift.com/kubernetes-custom-resources-grow-up-in-v1-10/)

    On the OpenShift blog, Nikhita Raghunath describes the new Custom Resource Definition features included in Kubernetes 1.10. Nikhita added both of these features as part of the Google Summer of Code, which she recapped in this blog post. Extensibility is a key selling point of Kubernetes for the kubelist editors, so we're always happy to see new additions and improvements.
1. [Observing Kubernetes Services With Veneur](https://varnull.adityamukerjee.net/2018/04/05/observing-kubernetes-services-with-veneur/)

    Veneur is a relatively new observability pipeline system, in the vein of Mozilla's old Heka project. In this post, Aditya Mukerjee describes setting up Veneur with Kuberentes. The kubelist editors are particularly intrigued by the "Global Aggregation" section of this post, and Veneur's use of HyperLogLog; haven't we all incorrectly counted the number of unique API clients connected to our platforms at one time or another?
1. [Draining Kubernetes nodes](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/drain/)

    One of the kubelist editors has been trying all morning to drain the nodes on our Raspberry Pi cluster so we can decommission our model 3 Bs for 3B+s. They're still looking for the spout to put their drain pan under.Avoid being the brunt of newsletter jokes, and learn how gracefully decommissioning a Kubernetes node works in this post by Marton Sereg.
1. [Hello, Heptio Cruise](https://blog.heptio.com/hello-cruise-491852b98a89)

    On the Heptio Blog, professional vintage welding goggle wearer Dave Cheney introduces Cruise, a tool to automatically setup Pingdom checks for new services in your cluster. The kubelist editors are staunch believers in the operator pattern demonstrated by this project. We hope that you, dear reader, will take inspiration from this post and begin automating your infrastructure from within.
1. [Tweet of the week](https://twitter.com/MayaKaczorowski/status/984106330616197126)

    Maya Kaczorowski provides an excellent infographic highlighting security features of Kubernetes, and when they were introduced. The kubelist editors would love to see more of these for other classes of features!
