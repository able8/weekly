## [Kubelist Issue #75 for 2019-08-08](https://kubelist.com/issue/75)

#### The In’s and Out’s of Kubernetes Security

> To avoid exploitation and the delivery of malicious bugs in Kubernetes, it is critical that your system is secure and containers are kept closed. Some of the most damaging attacks can lead to every pod and container to shut down and break. Security is vital, and that is what we will be looking at today. 

1. [Understanding Kubernetes Security](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/)

    Understanding the risks and how security comes into play with Kubernetes is essential. This article provides just that, plus it’s a nice bonus for beginners just learning security.
1. [A Guide to K8s Security](https://neuvector.com/container-security/kubernetes-security-guide/)

    A great part of this article to jump to would be “What to be Aware of: Kubernetes Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors”, where it explores the different kinds of attacks possible.
1. [Securing a Cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/securing-a-cluster/)

    Once one part of Kubernetes is secured, the rest will fall into play. Securing a cluster is a great first step into securing the rest of your system.
