#### Roll Them Bones

> As Kubernetes and microservices reshape the landscape of modern computing, we‚Äôre seeing businesses placing big bets - especially in enterprise. Read on to find out how IBM and Intel are leveraging Kubernetes for hybrid integration and machine learning. We also have something to help businesses make sound decisions as they adopt Kubernetes, a really great tutorial for developers looking to start learning, and a glimpse at the future of CD pipelines.

1. [New IBM Cloud Integration Platform Highlights Confusion Over Hybrid Integration](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2019/02/16/new-ibm-cloud-integration-platform-highlights-confusion-over-hybrid-integration)

    Make no mistake: the folks trying to sell you hybrid integration platforms have no idea what‚Äôs HIP! For truly hybrid IT, ditch the bimodal offerings and instead look ahead to the meshianic age of cloud native integration.
1. [Intel Bets Big On Kubernetes For Nauta Deep Learning Platform](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2019/01/30/intel-bets-big-on-kubernetes-for-nauta-deep-learning-platform)

    Distribute your workload in the public cloud, or on a local Xeon cluster! Intel is using Kubernetes to double down on multi-user machine learning in the enterprise space. But if it‚Äôs Nauta deep learning platform, then what is it?

    Sherlock Holmes seems to have learned more at his elementary school than dear Watson, but now there‚Äôs hope: Kubernetes has brought open enrollment to the cloud, so Watson can go and learn wherever we‚Äôre willing to send him.
1. [Deploy InfluxDB and Grafana on Kubernetes to collect Twitter stats](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/deploy-influxdb-grafana-kubernetes)

    The best way to learn a new tech is to use it to build something simple! Bonus points if it‚Äôs completely unnecessary. This guide will have you deploying three pods: one InfluxDB database, one Grafana dashboard, and one cron job to gather data from Twitter. It‚Äôs a great way to learn the Kubernetes fundamentals and understand how pods work together in a cluster.
1. [Kubernetes Pipelines- Hello, New World](https://www.deployhub.com/kubernetes-pipelines/)

    If you thought you had continuous delivery pipelines all figured out, I have to warn you, the new Kubernetes approach is really gonna mesh you up.
1. [7 Key Considerations for Kubernetes in Production](https://thenewstack.io/7-key-considerations-for-kubernetes-in-production/)

    If your business is thinking of adopting Kubernetes, make sure to do it right. DIY is a major footgun. These key considerations will help guide your thinking to set you up for success.
