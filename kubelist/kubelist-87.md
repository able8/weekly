## [Kubelist Issue #87 for 2020-06-03](https://kubelist.com/issue/87)

#### Kubelist will not be sending an issue or tweeting about Kubernetes this week.

> Instead, we’d like to create space to pause and reflect on the pain being felt in the United States and around the world. We know that a big part of what makes Kubernetes so special is its diverse and supportive community and we don’t want to distract from the voices that matter right now.
