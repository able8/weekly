## [DevOps'ish 169](https://devopsish.com/169) - Sun Mar 1, 2020

The first CNCF Air Gapped Working Group meeting happened this week. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend. Air gapped or disconnected environments have a few variants. But, the air gaps I‚Äôm most familiar with are those between unclassified and classified US government systems (TEMPEST, EMSEC, COMSEC, etc.). Also, given the attendance, there is a lot of interest from folks across the public and private sectors. If you‚Äôre interested in getting involved, <a href="https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-sig-app-delivery/topic/airgap_working_group_meeting/71568152">we‚Äôre figuring out what the cadence of the meetings will be</a>. The current scope of our work is to provide a ‚Äúcookbook‚Äù for maintaining an air gapped cloud native environment. Join the <a href="https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-sig-app-delivery/">CNCF SIG App Delivery mailing list</a> and keep an eye out for messages to see how to get involved.

The 2020 election for the <a href="https://wiki.opensource.org/bin/Main/OSI+Board+of+Directors/">Open Source Initiative Board of Directors</a> is rapidly approaching. I nominated myself for a seat on the board as an Individual Member. I spoke with a few friends in the months before submitting my nomination. It sounds like OSI could use my help <a href="http://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2020-February/021350.html">given the week they‚Äôve had</a>. Open source software has done nothing but provide opportunity after opportunity in my life. It should be cared for and maintained so that everyone willing can benefit from it as much as I have (hopefully more). If you‚Äôre an OSI member, <a href="https://wiki.opensource.org/bin/Main/OSI+Board+of+Directors/Board+Member+Elections/2020+Individual+and+Affiliate+Elections/Short2020">please considering me for a seat on the board</a>. If you‚Äôre not an OSI member, you have until 1 March 2020 to join to vote. However, if you work with open source software, <a href="https://opensource.org/join">you should be an OSI member</a>.
