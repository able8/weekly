## [DevOps'ish 105](https://devopsish.com/105) - Mon Dec 10, 2018

DevOps’ish turns two this week. Started on 2016-12-11 as a Medium publication, with an epoch for a subject line, only 632 characters, and no images to be found. A lot has changed but, a lot has stayed the same too. There’s no image again but, it’s not on Medium anymore. There’s a ton of news but, it’s still sourced by me. There’s more people reading and giving feedback but, I’m still grateful for every one of you. I’ll be at KubeCon (and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KubeKhan">#KubeKhan</a>) Sunday through Wednesday morning, Raleigh on Thursday, and Durham on Friday. The number to beat for hotel stays this week is three. Have fun, patch your Kubernetes clusters, and stay safe out there!

Here’s to another year of <a href="https://devopsish.com/"><strong>DevOps’ish</strong></a>! This newsletter was written from 35,000 feet above the United States.

<a href="https://www.gocd.org/tags/cd-analytics.html"><strong>Blog series: Actionable Continuous Delivery metrics</strong></a><br/>In this new blog series we will go through important concepts and use examples to address common issues like low deployment frequency, slow lead time, high change to fail percentage, high MTTR. <em>SPONSORED</em>

Learn how you can convert irregular time series to a regular on the fly by calculating an aggregate of individual values for arbitrary windows of time. <em>SPONSORED</em>

     This is a big deal. 2019 will bring an economic recession (not 2008 level but, within striking distance). Make sure you’re at a place in life that can weather it.
