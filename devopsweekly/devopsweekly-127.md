## [DevOps'ish 127](https://devopsish.com/127) - Sun May 12, 2019

Happy Mother’s Day! To the single moms, this day should be yours two times over. I’m sorry if you don’t even get so much as a bathroom break to yourself today. To the almost moms, this day is yours. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise; if they do, send them my way. To the moms that have lost a child, this day is especially yours. For those of us whose toxic moms have been extricated from our lives, this day might be a little heavier. That’s okay too; do what you need to do. No one says you can’t celebrate someone else’s awesome mom either. For example, Emily Freeman’s mom is the human embodiment of DevOps, honor her. Regardless, I hope everyone has a marvelous Mother’s Day.

### DevOps’ish Last Week’s Top Five

### People

1. [Dear Hollywood, here are 5 female founders to showcase instead of Elizabeth Holmes](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/dear-hollywood-here-are-five-female-founders-to-showcase-instead-of-elizabeth-holmes/)

     I’d rather watch a movie about the five women in this article than anything about Elizabeth Holmes.
1. [Do These 5 Emotionally Intelligent Things Within 5 Minutes Of Meeting](https://www.fastcompany.com/40441365/do-these-5-emotionally-intelligent-things-within-5-minutes-of-meeting-someone)

     This list is good. Hell, if you hit three of the five you’re doing great, especially #5.
1. [How to Stop Worrying About What Other People Think of You](https://hbr.org/2019/05/how-to-stop-worrying-about-what-other-people-think-of-you)

     In this line of work, personality matters. “If you start paying less and less attention to what makes you you — your talents, beliefs, and values — and start conforming to what others may or may not think, you’ll harm your potential.”
1. [10 Mistakes You Should Avoid During Your One on One Meetings](https://www.fellow.app/blog/2019/10-mistakes-you-should-avoid-during-one-on-one-meetings/)

     This list is pretty crucial. If you have a not so great manager, try to use this to help guide the discussion during 1:1s.
1. [How I became a Technology Advocate](https://kenmugrage.com/2019/05/09/how-i-became-a-technology-advocate/)

     My friend, Ken Mugrage, explains how he started doing what he does.
### Process

1. [What is DevOpsTell me I’m wrong](https://devopsish.com/what-is-devops/)

     ”If forced to put it in one sentence, I would describe DevOps as follows: ‘DevOps is the professional practice of frequent, continued, and iterative improvements through measurable changes, the goal of which is to become a high-velocity organization thus improving business outcomes.’” .
1. [DevOps is Dead with James TurnbullWhat is DevOps](https://www.realworlddevops.com/episodes/devops-is-dead-with-james-turnbull)

     ”I mean I’m being honest here on marketing now I think it’s probably a factor. To me, DevOps was almost nothing about tools, tools to me were enablers for folks doing DevOps things.” Says the gentleman hailing from a company with ‘Azure DevOps’ as a product. Is it fall? Can someone get me a pumpkin spice latte, please? I… Can’t… Even. That’s why tools are LAST in this newsletter. That’s why people are first and process is right after. Those two things matter more to DevOps than any single tool ever could attempt to. This is why in my end of 2018 article, Less DevOps, More Everything That Makes Up DevOps, was a headline. No one wants DevOps, but they do want all the outcomes. What DevOps Isn’t is a headline in the aforementioned  for good reason too. I don’t think Marketing is the issue with DevOps. I have spent time on both sides of the tables now. I feel the lack of clarity about what DevOps actually is from its leaders and founders is what lead us here. Welcome to the trough of disillusionment.

     ”A teenage boy successfully hacked a common drone in a stunt aimed at showing how vulnerable web-connected devices and the Internet of Things are to attacks.”

1. [Negotiations Failed: How Oracle killed Java EE](https://headcrashing.wordpress.com/2019/05/03/negotiations-failed-how-oracle-killed-java-ee/)

     ”Hence, it not only was inacceptable, but it was simply impossible to agree to Oracle’s requests, so the negotiations more or less completely failed.”

     A nice, concise list.
1. [Coming soon: Windows Terminal—finally a tabbed, emoji-capable Windows command-line](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/coming-soon-windows-terminal-finally-a-tabbed-emoji-capable-windows-command-line/)

     The really sad part is Windows users haven’t had emoji on the CLI all this time. In all seriousness, this is great for Windows users.
1. [Introducing the Red Hat Universal Base Image](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image)

     ”Less than a full operating system, UBI is three things: 1. A set of three base images (ubi, ubi-minimal, ubi-init) 2. A set of language runtime images (nodejs, ruby, python, php, perl, etc.) 3. A set of associated packages in a YUM repository which satisfy common application dependencies. Freely redistributable for community, partners and customers.” Kick the tires on this. I’m genuinely curious what folks think.

     ”TL;DR: containers are not VMs; stop calling everything “Docker”; don’t use Kubernetes for tiny projects, use Swarm instead; Kubernetes will only solve your org’s problems if you are willing to go all-in, anything in between will fail the same way it failed before.”
