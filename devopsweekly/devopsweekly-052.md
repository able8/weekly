This is the 52nd issue of <a href="https://devopsish.com/"><strong>DevOps’ish</strong></a>! While the official one-year anniversary is next week, there are 52 weeks in a year and now is as good a time as any to celebrate. In keeping with DevOps best practices, I shared some lessons learned in, <a href="https://chrisshort.net/notes-on-running-a-newsletter-a-year-of-devopsish/">Notes on Running a Newsletter: A Year of DevOps’ish</a>.

If you want to be entered to win, please complete the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/aVCS0AVwIyLouV1p2">DevOps’ish Diversity Form</a> for consideration. Winners will be announced in next week’s newsletter!
