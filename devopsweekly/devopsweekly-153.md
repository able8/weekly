## [DevOps'ish 153](https://devopsish.com/153) - Sun Nov 10, 2019

Note: DevOps‚Äôish will no longer publish an RSS feed. It‚Äôs a <a href="https://github.com/chris-short/devopsish.com/commit/8a1c7e0ec934aff626a10bf5f7b8b6d2e3faf53c">business decision</a> at this point. Please <a href="https://devopsish.com/subscribe/">subscribe</a> via e-mail. Subscribers seem to be the only metric potential sponsors care about. This change should ensure the long term viability of DevOps‚Äôish.

Are you ready for <a href="https://cshort.co/kcna19">KubeCon</a>? I‚Äôm not, but I hope to be by end of day Friday. There are a number of events every night (see Events section). If your calendar isn‚Äôt booked and you‚Äôre looking for something to do, several sponsors are hosting things across San Diego. I‚Äôll be arriving on Sunday midday and heading over to <a href="https://cloud-native.rejekts.io/">Cloud Native Rejekts</a>. Monday, I‚Äôll be helping at the New Contributor Summit. Tuesday and Wednesday are going to be non-stop Kubernetes and cloud native awesomeness. Thursday things seem to slow a little. When in doubt, I‚Äôll be near the Red Hat booth or supporting my friends that are speaking. I tell my family that this is essentially our Super Bowl for the year. I hope it doesn‚Äôt disappoint.

But, the event of the year we all know is <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23KubeKhan)&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">#KubeKhan</a>. The come as you are, judgment-free gathering is back this year with a little extra oomph thanks to our friends at <a href="https://cncf.io">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. It‚Äôs casual and will take place every night of KubeCon activities in some capacity. But, the first official night of #KubeKhan will be Monday, November, 18th at the Marriott Marquis¬Æ San Diego Marina starting around 7-ish. The <a href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/attend/code-of-conduct/">KubeCon Code of Conduct</a> will be adhered to.
