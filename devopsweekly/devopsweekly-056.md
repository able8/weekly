## [DevOps'ish 056](https://devopsish.com/056) - Sun Dec 31, 2017

The end of 2017 is upon us. Whether your 2017 was amazing or terrible I wish you all the best in 2018. I have very mixed feelings about this year. I feel like DevOps and open source software as a whole had a good 2017. I think 2018 will be quite interesting for this space. There will be numerous opportunities for open source software and its methodologies to continue to penetrate deeper into industries like the automotive and banking spaces.

I don’t like to do prediction pieces typically (although I do read them). Feedback from <a href="../054/">DevOps’ish 054</a> led me to believe that further analysis was needed on a brief piece of commentary I made regarding Docker: <a href="https://chrisshort.net/docker-inc-is-dead/"><strong>Docker, Inc. is Dead</strong></a>. The name Docker, while it remains a command on people’s systems, is more the name of a company and commercial service offering now than a container platform. I thought that was clear in the post but I had to change the title based on feedback I received. All feedback is appreciated; trolling does not equal feedback. When I say, “Docker is dead” I am referring to the company, not the software. The software will live on in one form or another for a long time; the company will not.

Combine several Raspberry Pis into a cluster and you now have an x10 or x100 multiplier, but there are some problems with SD Cards. Netbooting is meant to fix this — but there are some limitations to its usefulness.”
