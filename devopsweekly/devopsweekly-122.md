## [DevOps'ish 122](https://devopsish.com/122) - Sun Apr 7, 2019

Chef announced this week they were giving up on letting users have binaries for free. Instead, you now can have all the source code for free but, <a href="https://blog.chef.io/2019/04/02/chef-software-announces-the-enterprise-automation-stack/">not any of the binaries</a>. <a href="https://medium.com/@adamhjk/goodbye-open-core-good-riddance-to-bad-rubbish-ae3355316494">Adam Jacob</a> cited one company as having already adopted this model; <strong>Red Hat</strong> (my employer, see <a href="https://devopsish.com/terms/">disclaimer</a>). It’s a rather dubious claim because this <a href="https://sfosc.org/business-models/free-software-product/">Free Software Product</a> model, developed mostly by <a href="https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc/graphs/contributors">Adam Jacob in the past sixth months</a>, definitely does not predate Red Hat. I sure haven’t seen an announcement about how Red Hat is changing anything. Nor have I seen any policy about adopting this specific model (full disclosure, I was on PTO Friday). Regardless, I guess the thinking is if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

But, what if the Red Hat model didn’t work? <a href="https://investors.redhat.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2018/10-28-2018-184027500">Red Hat is getting acquired by IBM</a> but, is that a win? That remains to be seen. The Red Hat model is likely a win for investors once the acquisition closes. But, is that a win for open source? Are we even playing the same game? 🤔🤔🤔

Don’t get me wrong, I’m excited to see where all this goes. It’s a ridiculously exciting time to be working in this industry. It’s also a ridiculously turbulent time. Whether any of this works remains to be seen.

     Command Line Heroes is a podcast produced by my employer, Red Hat, but, it’s definitely not sales pitchy (at all). I have friends that have appeared on the podcast and just last week I sat here in my office with a producer and recorded for an episode. Please take the time to vote. Thank you!
1. [Verify @ashleymcnamaraa celebrity’s baby being verifiedEmily Freeman](https://chrisshort.net/verify-ashleymcnamara/)

     A lot of people were asking about 认证 @ashleymcnamara so I had to write a thing. In a nutshell, it’s Twitter being hypocritical as usual. IT’S NOT DIRECTLY DEVOPS RELATED. However, it is DevOps adjacent, as our network is engaging on Twitter. According to one Twitter engineer not at liberty to discuss the matter fearing retribution, the verified account program, “is still on hold.” But, confirmed someone is in charge of the program despite being on hold for two years. When pressed on , the engineer reminded me, “[Twitter] reserves the right to continue to verify on a case by case basis.” I don’t feel like I need to make a case for Ashley, Twitter. Verify her and every other woman in tech like her that have applied (like ). It’s called goodwill after being a shitty platform.
