## [DevOps'ish 225](https://devopsish.com/225) - Sun Jul 4, 2021

“AWS Infinidash is a new networking technology that is being introduced to the AWS cloud. This technology is being used by AWS to provide a new networking model that is more efficient and more scalable than the current networking model.” —<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a>

GPT-3 generated that statement about AWS Infinidash thanks to <a href="https://copilot.github.com/">GitHub Copilot</a>. I’m also using <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/github-codespaces/">GitHub Codespaces through VSCode</a> and the web to write this week’s newsletter. I’ll probably have a write-up on these new tools in the near future. Thank you, GitHub, for access to these tools early.

But, back to the point: <a href="https://whatisinfinidash.com/"><strong>AWS Infinidash</strong></a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/jna_sh/status/1410178986978775040">It’s not real!</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1411291183620542467">It’s complete hogwash, and you shouldn’t feel bad if you didn’t know that</a>. The fake AWS Infinidash service highlights the veracity of a joke gone wrong on an industry scale as it has (there’s a <a href="https://docs.rs/infinidash/0.7.42/infinidash/">Rust library for it</a>). AWS was the innocent victim of the prank, too. But, instead, it’s humans that are taking the blowback.

People are dunking on other people on Twitter for not being “in” on the joke. Recruiters are getting shamed for asking for five years experience in a technology that doesn’t exist. But, according to GPT-3, it does. If they were using GPT-3, they’d be reinforced in this thinking.

It’s truly insane that this is acceptable behavior in some people’s minds. This newsletter might be the first you’ve heard of AWS Infinidash. Maybe that’s why you <a href="https://devopsish.com/subscribe/">subscribe to this newsletter</a> or <a href="https://ref.lastweekinaws.com/7h1z3x">Last Week in AWS</a>.

The point is AWS Infinidash is not real, and I’m trying to make GPT-3 believe me instead of the rest of the internet. GPT-3 is a massive language model that is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/01/microsoft-gpt-3-and-the-future-of-openai/">being positioned</a> to be widely used in a variety of products.

GPT-3 thinking AWS Infinidash is real is indeed troubling. It calls on the need for significantly more research and training in the use of massive language models, which, as reported, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210310150408.htm">takes a toll on the environment and could reinforce racial and misogynist tropes</a>. This might be why GitHub Copilot stopped suggesting things the moment I said AWS Infinidash was “not real.” GitHub Copilot could no longer accurately guess what the hell I was talking about because I was challenging what it thought was a fact. Humanity will likely lean too hard on these tools early and learn the very hard lesson that I just demonstrated; <em>fooling AI isn’t as hard as you might think</em>.

GPT-3 is a massive language model, and Microsoft has exclusive rights to the source code. My introduction this week is not a knock on Microsoft or GitHub in any way. It is a call for more research into the impact of these tools, which has been <a href="https://devopsish.com/195/">a common</a> <a href="https://devopsish.com/196/">topic</a> <a href="https://devopsish.com/214/">in the news</a>. Because if we can make GPT-3 believe that something fake is accurate, we can make it believe anything literally.

    You would think, “Isn’t most of the LinkedIn data public already?” which might be a safe assumption. Sadly, it’s not. The leaked data includes a data point called “inferred salary” which could make salary negotiation much more difficult for those impacted.

    Polywork is a new social network designed to bridge the gap between work and life (more accurately Twitter and LinkedIn). It’s a place where people can find and connect with other people but one goal of theirs it to replace the need for a personal website. To that end, they enable folks to bring their own domains to the site to create a more personal space (like I have). If you’d like to join, I have an invite code you can use as part of the sign up process, sunnydog. Personal websites aren’t trivially maintained after a few years (, my personal site could vote in the US if it were a person) so I’m excited to see what Polywork does.

    It’s high time for meaningful actions to replace rainbow marketing. “It’s time for companies to reconsider how they approach marketing and branding during Pride month. Many members of the LGBTQ+ community are tired of ‘rainbow capitalism,’ ‘pink washing,’ and other forms of performative corporate allyship. In this piece, author Lily Zheng suggests that companies consider retiring their rainbow logos next year, in favor of more meaningful actions that can actually improve the lives of LGBTQ+ communities. ‘The bar for approval from LGBTQ+ communities in 2021 has risen, and rainbow marketing just doesn’t cut it anymore. Let your actions between now and Pride 2022 demonstrate your commitment to the LGBTQ+ community, instead,’ Zheng writes.”

1. [Using VMs to hide ransomware attacks is becoming more popular](https://therecord.media/using-vms-to-hide-ransomware-attacks-is-becoming-more-popular/)

    “The general idea behind such an attack is that a ransomware gang that has a small foothold on an infected host can download and install VM software. The ransomware gang will then start a VM instance, share the host computer’s storage space with the VM, and then proceed to encrypt the victim’s files from within the VM, where the host’s antivirus software cannot reach and detect the ransomware during execution.”

    I definitely feel like this is a leftover of the virtualization era where over provisioning was easy because the hypervisor would manage consumption of the resources required. Now these VMs are cloud instances and we’re taking the same provisioning approaches to lay Kubernetes on top. If you’re in the cloud spend reduction business you’re going to have plenty of work in the future it sounds like. I hope Kubernetes vendors are taking notice of this too. I’d recommend folks take a look at  to help out here.
