## [DevOps'ish 121](https://devopsish.com/121) - Sun Mar 31, 2019

There is something to be said about simplicity. The amount of <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx">yak shaving</a> needed these days is enormous. I’ve been on and off trying to get a container up and running in a cloud native manner. I’ve tried all of the major cloud providers and a few more. But, to a cloud, they all have inadequacies of one sort or another. If one has weird load balancing, the other has an absurdly expensive database service (compared to the competition). If one has a clean Kubernetes implementation, the other is missing a few features. This stuff isn’t easy and if anyone thinks it is they’ve likely gotten ahold of a round peg they can force into a square hole more times than not. Keep your heads up out there.
