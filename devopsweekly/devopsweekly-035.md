## [DevOps'ish 035](https://devopsish.com/035) - Sun Aug 6, 2017

It’s 67 degrees here in Michigan at the moment. How’s the weather where you are? I’m not missing the humidity of the south at all. As I venture out into more of Detroit I’m continually pleased with the choice to move to the Mitten. America’s high five has a lot going for it! <a href="http://www.dailydetroit.com/2017/08/03/metro-detroit-unemployment-rate-sees-largest-drop-u-s-now-lower-boston-l-new-york/">Metro Detroit Unemployment Rate Sees Largest Drop In U.S., Now Lower Than Boston, L.A. And New York</a>.

An additional thing that started here in Detroit this week is the <a href="https://detroitgolang.com/">Detroit Go Meetup</a>! That’s right! Detroit is home to quite a few Go developers. When I went to GopherCon I found out that Go developers didn’t have a local community in Detroit. That changed this week. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DetroitGolang/events/242260260/">Join us as we welcome Sam Boyer at our first Meetup on August 29th</a>!

We are about a month away from <a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-raleigh/welcome/"><strong>DevOpsDay Raleigh</strong></a>. I’m WAY behind in updating the web site. But, why haven’t you gotten your tickets yet?!? Do you not realize who is going to be speaking? <a href="https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara">Ashley McNamara</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisindurham">Chris Collins</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/normalfaults">Nirmal Mehta</a>, <a href="https://chrisshort.net">ME</a>, and many more! Oh and someone named <a href="https://twitter.com/botchagalupe">**John Willis</a>** whom I hear is a big deal. The ticket is already super affordable but, there is a $5 discount code available with code <strong>MEETUP5</strong>. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/devopsdays-raleigh-2017-tickets-34044332515?aff=es2">Get your tickets today</a> because is the next week or two we expect them to get scarce.
