## [DevOps'ish 025](https://devopsish.com/025) - Sun May 28, 2017

Memorial Day has many meanings but, this weekend I will remember those we’ve lost in service to freedom around the globe. Take a moment to reflect on the good in the world this weekend. Remember, living our lives to their fullest are the best thing we can do to honor them.

The world of DevOps was a little chaotic this week. More and more I realize that people need a shock to the system to realize that they are just layering on more and more technical debt while driving themselves to obsolescence. We as a society have become two things: 1) a disposable society in which we would rather get something new than fixing a broken thing, and 2) an Apple society in which we expect simplistic concepts to have equally simplistic implementations. “It just works” has permeated our consciousness. Not many people care how it works.
