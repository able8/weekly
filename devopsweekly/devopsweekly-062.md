## [DevOps'ish 062](https://devopsish.com/062) - Sat Feb 10, 2018

This was a very interesting week for me. I participated in a chronic pain treatment study at the Ann Arbor VA Hospital early Tuesday morning. The experience, while odd, went incredibly well. Today is the first day I have felt noticeable pain which is likely due to managing Max at my nephew’s birthday date. If you know me, you know this is an incredible feat. On Thursday, I attended a brand new <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Kubernetes-Docker-all-things-Cloud-Native/">Kubernetes Meetup in Downtown Detroit</a>. It was fabulous! Mack and Uzo have some great ideas and I hope to collaborate with them on a few ideas we came up with after the Meetup. The coming week will be nuts!

If you’re around any of these places or events please don’t hesitate to stop me and say hello. Then I’ll be speaking at <a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-charlotte/">DevOpsDays Charlotte</a> the following week. DevOps the fuck up, y’all!

     If you would have asked me this time last year I would have told you “DevOps Engineer” is a legit title. But, I now know that is no longer the case. If you’re creating a DevOps team within a larger engineering organization you are creating silos.
