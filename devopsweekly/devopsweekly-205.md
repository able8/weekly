## [DevOps'ish 205](https://devopsish.com/205) - Sun Feb 14, 2021

First off, Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day. I hope you‚Äôre enjoying it as best you can.

This week I learned that an organization in the healthcare industry is working on a large project involving Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/">Pod Security Policies</a> as a mainstay in their project. In case you haven‚Äôt heard, Pod Security Policies (PSPs) will begin the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/">Kubernetes deprecation process</a> in the 1.21 release. Kubernetes 1.21 releases on or about Thursday, April 8th, 2021. With PSPs being completely phased out by the 1.25 release (sometime in mid‚Äôish 2022). When 1.21 is released, you‚Äôll see a message similar to the following when touching PSPs, ‚ÄúThe PodSecurityPolicy API is deprecated in 1.21, and will no longer be served starting in 1.25.‚Äù The <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/communication/marketing-team">Kubernetes Contributor Marketing Team</a> is working on an official blog post, but it is taking longer than I‚Äôd prefer given the amount of PSP utilization that‚Äôs out there.

I‚Äôm writing this here because I have worked in large banks, healthcare systems, and government agencies where changes like this could take quite some time to plan, test, verify, and implement. But, what is replacing PSPs? Well, that‚Äôs to be determined, which is equally terrifying to some. But, this is where folks have to have faith in the process. Sometimes we have to plan deprecation of something to force the community to respond to fill the gap.

Right now, from my seat, a viable replacement is <a href="https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/">Open Policy Agent‚Äôs Gatekeeper</a>. Open Policy Agent (OPA) has recently moved to a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2021/02/04/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-open-policy-agent-graduation/">graduated CNCF Project</a>. OPA is ready for production implementation. At this time, again, in my opinion, <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">OPA</a> will be the de facto replacement for PSPs in the future. But, I will admit, the future is hard to predict at this level. There very well be many more viable alternatives in six to twelve months.

Other projects and products can help manage and enforce what pod requirements are for Kubernetes clusters. I will not be touching on those because, to be honest, <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=security-compliance&amp;grouping=category">there are a lot of potential solutions</a> in the CNCF Landscape. One of those alternatives has rubbed me wrong during the writing process of the PSP deprecation blog post. It‚Äôs not their place to force us to provide a complete picture of the ecosystem in a singular blog post. We‚Äôre trying to stay scoped to inform the masses of a deprecation. In the wake of the <a href="https://devopsish.com/195/">dockershim deprecation</a>, this is already hard enough. The Upstream Marketing team has a <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/marketing-team/CHARTER.md">charter</a>. We wrote the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/marketing-team/CHARTER.md#ethosvision">Ethos/Vision part of the subproject‚Äôs charter</a> to prevent such behavior. State your case, don‚Äôt try to force others to state it on your behalf.

Regardless, Kubernetes Pod Security Policies are going away and folks need to prepare for that. Start assessing what is using PSPs in your environment, what requirements it‚Äôs implementing, and find a solution that can replicate that functionality.

With Release, you can get a full instance of your app with all of its services with every pull request. Your developers will never have to fight over staging environments again. . SPONSORED

    ‚ÄúEven if your company is committed to diversity inclusion, you might have hidden biases in your hiring strategies. According to recent research on the hiring practices at several prestigious firms, this can take several forms. For example, you might view unpaid internships more favorably than other types of summer jobs, which introduces socioeconomic bias. And you might think that minority and female candidates are less likely to accept a job if offered because so many other firms are also interested in hiring them (something, incidentally, the research doesn‚Äôt bear out); because of this, you might be less likely to pursue those candidates. So, if you‚Äôre truly committed to diversifying your organization, take a hard look at your hiring processes and face up the fact that they might not be as effective in practice as they are in intention.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúChronic illness is extremely common, and the Covid-19 pandemic has helped normalize talking about it in the workplace. It can be hard to know what to say to an employee with a chronic illness ‚Äî it‚Äôs an emotional topic, and your own assumptions can get in the way of real understanding. There are three steps managers can take to ensure they approach these conversations with empathy and confidence. First, take your own emotions out of it. Second, challenge your views about what counts as great work. Third, approach with curiosity and do your research. The experiences of employees experiencing chronic illness can offer valuable lessons to all employees.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúParticipants suggested that developers may only have a six- to nine-month advantage until others can reproduce their results. It was widely agreed upon that those on the cutting edge should use their position on the frontier to responsibly set norms in the emerging field,‚Äù the paper reads. ‚ÄúThis further suggests the urgency of using the current time window, during which few actors possess very large language models, to develop appropriate norms and principles for others to follow.‚Äù Just don‚Äôt fuck it up.
