## [DevOps'ish 107](https://devopsish.com/107) - Sun Dec 23, 2018

As mentioned <a href="https://devopsish.com/106/">last week</a>, I was able to finish <a href="https://chrisshort.net/kubecon-cloudnativecon-na-2018/">my KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2018 recap</a> this week. It‚Äôs not an exhaustive list of things I did but, it covers the big ones. One point of emphasis for me was to assess the physical toil I managed along the way. It‚Äôs important to note that life doesn‚Äôt stop because you‚Äôre at a conference. <a href="https://discuss.kubernetes.io/t/videos-from-the-kubernetes-contributor-summit-are-now-available/3907">Videos from the Kubernetes Contributor Summit are now available</a> too.

I‚Äôm on PTO this week. I thought about DevOps‚Äôish taking its first week off ever. But, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessary so here‚Äôs to over two years of uninterrupted <a href="https://devopsish.com/">DevOps‚Äôish</a>!
