## [DevOps'ish 033](https://devopsish.com/033) - Sun Jul 23, 2017

Sunday, I flew back to NC to help close and move out of our house. It has turned into quite the saga that I won’t bother with trying to explain to everyone. But, having injections on moving day was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. The world of <a href="https://devopsish.com/"><strong>DevOps</strong></a> was quite busy this week. Also, several great <a href="https://github.com/gophercon/2017-talks">talks from GopherCon are available in various forms</a>, including my GopherCon 2017 Lightning Talk: <a href="https://chrisshort.net/testing-certificate-chains-in-go/">Golang to the rescue: Saving DevOps from TLS turmoil</a>. Last, but not least, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/K8sBday?src=hash">happy second birthday, Kubernetes!</a>

     Here’s an important observation on all this: at present, we know secure pages are secure because the browser tells us so. We know non-secure pages are not secure because the browser doesn’t tell us that they’re secure. Get it? It’s the principle of being insecure by default and that’s what we’re increasingly moving away from.
