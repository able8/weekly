## [DevOps'ish 070](https://devopsish.com/070) - Sun Apr 8, 2018

Towards the end of my workday on Tuesday, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/livid-over-sites-policies-youtube-shooter-trained-for-attack-shot-randomly/">tragedy struck the YouTube HQ in San Bruno, CA</a>. A shooter made their way through a parking deck to a patio where people were eating and socializing. The shooter opened fire claiming three victims before turning the weapon on themselves. In Google’s <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/">Project Aristotle</a>, psychological safety is identified as the number one contributor to “What makes a team effective at Google?” In the wake of this random act of violence, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/04/scope-of-youtube-shooters-plan-probed-as-shaken-staffers-recover/">Google’s response</a> might be the most watched handling of a workplace shooting. This is not the postmortem we want. But, this could be the postmortem we need.
