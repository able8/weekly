    “Walking is one of the simplest and most strategic things you can do for yourself. It takes little preparation, minimal effort, no special equipment, and it can contract or expand to fit the exact amount of time you have available. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a single bout of moderate-to vigorous activity (including walking) can improve our sleep, thinking, and learning, while reducing symptoms of anxiety.” Can confirm from multiple walks this week.

1. [Hildegard: New TeamTNT Cryptojacking Malware Targeting Kubernetes](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/hildegard-malware-teamtnt/)

    “In January 2021, Unit 42 researchers detected a new malware campaign targeting Kubernetes clusters. The attackers gained initial access via a misconfigured kubelet that allowed anonymous access. Once getting a foothold into a Kubernetes cluster, the malware attempted to spread over as many containers as possible and eventually launched cryptojacking operations. Based on the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) that the attackers used, we believe this is a new campaign from TeamTNT. We refer to this new malware as Hildegard, the username of the tmate account that the malware used.”

    “In August and September 2020, Verisign quantified that upwards of 45.80% of total DNS traffic to the root servers was, at the time, the result of Chromium intranet redirection detection tests. Since then, the Chromium team has redesigned its code to disable the redirection test on Android systems and introduced a multi-state DNS interception policy that supports disabling the redirection test for desktop browsers. This functionality was released mid-November of 2020 for Android systems in Chromium 87 and, quickly thereafter, the root servers experienced a rapid decline of DNS queries.” Damn.
