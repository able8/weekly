## [DevOps'ish 128](https://devopsish.com/128) - Sun May 19, 2019

No. Contrary to what everyone I’ve talked to this week thinks, I’m not going to KubeCon Barcelona. I don’t think I was really planning on it at the beginning of the year. I believe it was added to my schedule right before my Shingles diagnosis. Let me tell you, Shingles is bullshit. I’ve been battling a flare-up of the nerve pain today and it’s gnarly af. I was going to discuss the use of the term “best practice” this week but, I need to go get some rest. Instead, lend me your thoughts. <a href="https://twitter.com/Kate_Catlin/status/1128403226678587393">The Tweet of the Week this week</a> provides the thinking behind modifying or eliminating the use of the phrase “best practices”. <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1129342806307278848">I asked for clarification from the greater community this week</a> and the conversation was insightful. Check it all out and let me know what you think (Twitter, email, Telegram, etc.)!
