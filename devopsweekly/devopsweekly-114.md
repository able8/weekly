## [DevOps'ish 114](https://devopsish.com/114) - Mon Feb 11, 2019

This week was very interesting filled with unusual experiences. Shared learning is a tenet of DevOps so allow me to share my experiences with you. Hopefully, we all get better as a result. Let‚Äôs break down two experiences from this week.

You may have noticed on Twitter or in last week‚Äôs newsletter some mention about a webinar I was planning to take part in with Scalyr. <a href="https://gitlab.com/chrisshort/devopsish.com/commit/d58b6885e343992a2728c81f8a0c5ad543450c9e#6b7f082a8a7a9dfd2fcb6e0d928bff74b342f7f1_24_24">I have canceled that</a>. We were going to discuss DevOps in a Kubernetes world. I still might discuss that at some point with another audience. But, I‚Äôm not going to talk about it with the Scalyr team. It came down to something elementary, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1092775980882644993">don‚Äôt insult anyone</a>. Don‚Äôt make light of <strong><em>ANYONE</em></strong> even jokingly in a professional e-mail. With e-mail, there is no sarcasm, no tone, and context can sometimes be cloudy. Especially don‚Äôt insult yourself and your profession. I had a nice chat with Scalyr‚Äôs VP of Marketing and have forwarded the e-mails to CNCF (Scalyr reached out via the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/speakers/">CNCF Speaker‚Äôs Bureau</a>). I hope Scalyr has learned a valuable lesson. If you see Scalyr being even the slightest bit untoward, let me know, I‚Äôll address it with them. Be the person you want your peers to epitomize.

Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) is a hard, continuous, and iterative journey. When you make small wins, celebrate them accordingly. Celebrating small victories in a big way is disingenuous. Let‚Äôs face it the tech industry is terrible at this. Having a not <a href="http://allmalepanels.tumblr.com/">all-male speaker lineup or panel</a> seems to qualify as diverse these days. That is missing the boat on diversity and inclusion quite a bit though. While the group Red Hat assembled for Ansible Automates Chicago exceeded my minimum viable panel participation criteria of minimum one woman and one other underrepresented minority, I still wouldn‚Äôt call the Q&amp;A panel diverse. I would concede it‚Äôs better than average. <a href="https://twitter.com/microsoft/status/1092246632320532480">The industry needs to normalize diversity and inclusiveness</a>. Should video games only be limited to the perfectly able? No! Another example of normalizing behavior, don‚Äôt introduce a woman as a woman that also does something. Introduce her based on accomplishments and accolades. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6499969633217495041">We can do so much better</a> as an industry and a society. Let‚Äôs get there together.

<a href="https://www.gocd.org/2019/01/14/cd-metrics-deployment-lead-time/"><strong>Use Lead Time Metric to Improve Your CI/CD Process</strong></a><br/>Check out GoCD‚Äôs latest blog in CD Metrics series. It talks about what lead time means in CD context and guides you on how to identify bottlenecks and improve your CI/CD process. <em>SPONSORED</em>

<a href="https://www.meetup.com/triangle-devops/events/257189603/"><strong>Triangle DevOps presents DevOps is Not War with Chris Short of Red Hat</strong></a><br/>Over the past 500 years, there have been 16 cases of a rising power threatening to displace a ruling power. 75% of those cases resulted in war. Although your organizational transformation probably won‚Äôt lead to war, it could be contentious. History can help prevent conflict when driving change. This talk will analyze human tendencies, historical data, and provide real-world examples of how to avoid friction during your DevOps journey. <em>SPONSORED</em>
