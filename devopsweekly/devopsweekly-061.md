## [DevOps'ish 061](https://devopsish.com/061) - Sun Feb 4, 2018

I’ve had an absolutely amazing week! I was named a <a href="https://chrisshort.net/chris-short-named-cloud-native-ambassador/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation Ambassador</a>. My friend, Chris Bailey, and I recorded an episode of <a href="http://techtowntraining.com/podcastgen/">Techtown’s Discussing DevOps Details (3D) Podcast</a>. I spoke at the <a href="https://chrisshort.net/orchestructure-january-2018-meetup/">Orchestructure January 2018 Meetup</a> about Golang accelerating DevOps. Last, but certainly not least, I was named an <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/2/community-awards-2018">opensource.com 2018 People’s Choice Award</a> winner. I also booked travel for Open Source 101 in Raleigh and DevOpsDays Charlotte. I don’t know how I can top this week. But, I tend to compete with myself; I’m sure I’ll come up with something.

    is being acquired by  for $250 million! However, people in the community are holding judgment on if this is a good thing. . But, the Openshift team fired off . The tweet stated, “With the acquisition of CoreOS, Red Hat engineers now Lead or Co-Lead 15 Kubernetes SIGs.” As , “This should be a call for broader community participation to avoid single-vendor concentration.” I couldn’t agree more. I now believe Google and Red Hat have WAY too much power in the Kubernetes ecosystem. But, It’s better than just Google OR Red Hat having too much power.
