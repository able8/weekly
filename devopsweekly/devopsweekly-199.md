## [DevOps'ish 199](https://devopsish.com/199) - Sun Jan 3, 2021

<strong>Note:</strong> If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre winning. You beat 2020. Also, the <a href="https://devopsish.com/solarwinds-supply-chain-compromise/">DevOps‚Äôish Solarwinds supply chain compromise Index</a> has been updated.

I was talking to DevOps‚Äôish readers a bit this week. One reader, in particular, has mentioned in the past that they‚Äôd be willing to help put the newsletter together when I‚Äôm recovering from surgeries or need a day off. This morning I sat down to get a headstart on the newsletter and realized I should instead work on a checklist or HOWTO or whatever it would end up getting called. Let me introduce you to DevOps‚Äôish‚Äôs <strong><a href="https://github.com/chris-short/devopsish.com/blob/main/WRITING.md#devopsish-writing-process">WRITING.md</a></strong> file. It details how the newsletter is made and some of the guidelines around writing a newsletter, in general. It‚Äôs made me realize that I need to look into automating more of what I do. That‚Äôs one of the beautiful parts of checklists or good documentation; it tells you where to start looking into automation points.

Another thing we discussed is profit sharing and how that would have to get figured out. Or rather, we need to talk about how to figure that out. Which then triggered an early afternoon of getting <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/chris-short"><strong>GitHub Sponsor</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/devopsish"><strong>Patreon</strong></a> up and running. Getting good, long term newsletter sponsors is difficult. Larger newsletters generally outsource it. That seems a little much for me right now. If this system proves to work well, I will flip regular sponsors over to it potentially.

I‚Äôm sure every reader gets some value out of <a href="https://devopsish.com/">DevOps‚Äôish</a>. I‚Äôd like those willing to contribute to offset the costs and time it takes to research, maintain, and write DevOps‚Äôish to be able to do so. Pay if you want! No shame if you don‚Äôt. Also, I‚Äôm very open to suggestions here.

Also, I‚Äôm running an experiment. If you use Product Hunt, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/devops-ish">upvote DevOps‚Äôish‚Äôs Product Hunt listing</a>. Yes, I know it‚Äôs four years old, that‚Äôs part of the experiment.

Last but not least, if you love reading the news as I do, I would recommend you checking out <a href="https://scroll.com/friend/5tcafja7su632ugitrnsnbcvr9">Scroll</a> with your extra holiday money. It‚Äôs a really awesome concept and I hope it catches on like wildfire.

    Some of my best bosses were women. The article talks about how countries led by women fared better during the pandemic.

These aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsoft skills‚Äù at all; they‚Äôre foundational and core ones.
