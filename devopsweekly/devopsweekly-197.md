## [DevOps'ish 197](https://devopsish.com/197) - Sun Dec 20, 2020

This being a holiday break my intros will probably be a little bit shorter than normal. “More punchy” as my first boss at Red Hat would say. Let’s start with the thing with an ever-increasing blast radius: <strong>Solarwinds</strong>.

For the record, Reuters has been all over this coverage wise. I can’t do them justice. This story has been evolving so rapidly that by the time I hit send, my coverage will be incomplete. Everything from Russian hackers to insider trading to putting a global sinkhole in place for the command and control (C2) domain.

This is a truly terrifying compromise at a company <a href="https://chrisshort.net/resume/">I genuinely enjoyed working for in the past</a>. No, I never touched the Orion product while I worked there. Perhaps I should have. But, over the years, I’ve been in contact with more places than I can count that use Solarwinds Orion. It really is everywhere that has a big enough footprint to justify it. Governments included. This might turn out to be bigger than the OPM hack when the dust settles. I decided to build an <a href="https://devopsish.com/categories/Indexes">Index</a> page to provide continuing coverage of the <a href="https://devopsish.com/solarwinds-supply-chain-compromise/"><strong>Solarwinds supply chain compromise</strong></a>. When in doubt, go to this page for vetted info.

There’s already a lot of coverage and it will continue to grow. Here’s where you the reader can help round out the coverage. Feel free to add missing links yourself (and help me enjoy my downtime a little more); <a href="https://github.com/chris-short/devopsish.com/">pull requests welcome</a> or you can e-mail or <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort">DM me on Twitter</a>.

1. [Use OKRs to Set Goals for Teams, Not Individuals](https://hbr.org/2020/12/use-okrs-to-set-goals-for-teams-not-individuals)

    This drove me a little batty at one employer. Now I at least no why. “Setting individual OKRs generally leads to goals that are either not true indications of meaningful progress or that are easily gameable. Instead, individual contributors should be assessed based on the extent to which their work contributes to team goals that add real value to the company and its customers.”
1. [State of Women in Tech Report 2020](https://womenwhotech.com/data-and-resources/state-women-tech-and-startups)

    Women Who Tech’s annual report shows that half of women founders have been harassed in the past twelve months; 41% of that harassment was sexual harassment. “Nearly 50% of women founders were told they would raise more money if they were a man.” Additionally, “Women in tech aren’t reporting the harassment they experience to senior leadership at the same rate as they have previously.” WOMEN DESERVE BETTER! Forward this to a scumbag you know. Tell them you expect better. The only way we stop this vile and insane behavior is by having people that look like the scumbags standing up against them. They’re bullies and criminals, they should be treated and dealt with as such. I’m tired of this shit and I’m pulling cards in 2021, believe that.

1. [Why Capable People Are Reluctant to Lead](https://hbr.org/2020/12/why-capable-people-are-reluctant-to-lead)

    I don’t want to lead folks right now for a variety of reasons. Mainly because the last time I managed people I was brought in to help transform an org, which to leadership, meant to be an ax. I don’t roll like that. It’s on the list of things I need to tackle through therapy, to be honest. As a matter of fact, that job likely led to an acceleration of a decline in my mental health. Leadership is brutal in some orgs.
1. [Retail Sales Fell More Than Expected as Spending Slowed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/business/us-retail-sales-november.html)

    I foresee a tougher economy ahead. A lot tougher as our change in behavior due to COVID-19 changes a number of spending habit changes across the world. The US administration could do something about it to help, but I do not think what is being kicked around in Congress is going to help anything long term.

    The rapid adoption of Kubernetes to manage containerized workloads is driving great efficiencies in application development, deployment, and scalability. However, when security becomes an afterthought, you risk diminishing the greatest gain of containerization - agility.  to learn how to (1) build secure images and prevent untrusted/vulnerable code, (2) configure RBAC, network policies, and runtime privileges, (3) detect unauthorized runtime activity, and (4) secure your Kubernetes infrastructure components such as the API server.

Josh Berkus sums it up well in , “The fact that the term ‘docker’ refers to a CLI, a server, a container runtime, a container building tool, and an online container host has never not been confusing.”

    ARM is the future. You can run  thanks largely to Go’s early embrace of non-x86 architectures. “In the past year, several major vendors have made announcements of new ARM64 hardware for servers, laptops and developer machines. Go was well-positioned for this. For years now, Go has been powering Docker, Kubernetes, and the rest of the Go ecosystem on ARM64 Linux servers, as well as mobile apps on ARM64 Android and iOS devices.”
