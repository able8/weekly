    I always love it when people ask if I know Corey Quinn. Yes, we’re friends on two different sides of the country (we have the technology, it is possible).  last year on our family trip to San Francisco and Yosemite. I bought Max the  for his birthday this week because that trip made such an impact on him as a person. The Quinn Family played a huge part of that. Corey is on my incredibly short Christmas card list. When my friends are trying to do good in the world I like to highlight that.

    “When Lesley Carhart joined a start-up in the early 2000s, she was the first woman there to work in a technical role. That became obvious when she went to the marketing office to pick up her company shirts, required for anyone interacting with clients. The company didn’t have shirts for women. Instead, there were men’s shirts sizes large through extra, extra-large.”

    People might say traces can be used anywhere, but let’s face it: you absolutely need them when you’re dealing with distributed systems and microservices. You probably don’t have them yet because instrumenting your apps to collect them will get you super table-flippy. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

    “For now, there’s only one but very important consequence: independent analysis of a microcode patch that was impossible until now,” Positive Technologies researcher Mark Ermolov said. “Now, researchers can see how Intel fixes one or another bug/vulnerability. And this is great. The encryption of microcode patches is a kind of security through obscurity.”

    “An RIAA takedown request, which removed the YouTube-DL repository from GitHub, has ticked off developers and GitHub’s CEO.

My take, this is a pretty big step forward for an organization that a year ago did not have an open source offering at all. I hope to see more companies releasing tools that make their engineers more productive in the cloud native security landscape. I’ll be continuing to kick the tires on this as the week progresses.
