## [DevOps'ish 047](https://devopsish.com/047) - Sun Oct 29, 2017

If you <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort">follow me on Twitter</a>, you know I spent the first half of the week in Raleigh attending <a href="https://allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bar4enlAXVV/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=thechrisshort">hanging out with my opensource.com family</a>. All Things Open is one of my most looked forward to conferences of the year. I had already committed to attending before I moved to Detroit and I‚Äôm so glad I was able to go. One of the coolest things I did while there was announcing a new <a href="https://opensource.com/devops-team"><strong>Opensource.com DevOps Team</strong></a> with Jason Hibbets on the main stage after my lightning talk. <a href="https://opensource.com/devops-team">Join us on this journey</a>! It‚Äôs going to be awesome!
