## [DevOps'ish 017](https://devopsish.com/017) - Sun Apr 2, 2017

I started a new on-call rotation this week and it has really sucked. The team whose rotation I was added on to is mature in a few areas but monitoring and alerting seems to be lacking a little. They acknowledge that and my coming on to the rotation is partially to identify areas of improvement. The rotation I was on a couple weeks ago for a different team resulted in no pages all week and my bringing the team donuts.

This weekâ€™s rotation has resulted in a page every night (and two shorter maintenance events). The team that got donuts is very weak in some areas that this weekâ€™s team is not. But the donut team focused on monitoring and alerting as well as not waking people up and it shows.

Part of my job is to bring consistency to these teams that are separated 3,676 miles apart. Sharing expertise, processes, and procedures is part of the gig. The deficiencies in tooling have been identified. The need for personnel has been fulfilled. Now itâ€™s time to bring on the processes and results.

The good news is I organized and lead my first <a href="https://tridevops.com">Triangle DevOps</a> meetup on Wednesday night. It was a blast! <a href="https://twitter.com/Josh_Atwell">Josh Atwell</a> did a superb job speaking (the GIF is glorious), <a href="http://www.selectgroup.com/">The Select Group</a> fed us well, and <a href="http://transloc.com/">Transloc</a> was a fantastic host.
