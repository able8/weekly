## [DevOps'ish 146](https://devopsish.com/146) - Sun Sep 22, 2019

Just when you thought a toxic, old, white guy with lousy hygiene was going to dominate the news this week, in walks <a href="https://twitter.com/sethvargo">Seth Vargo</a>. On Thursday, Seth Vargo, a former Chef employee, learned something he wasn’t comfortable with about code he’d written. Seth discovered Chef had an active contract with the US Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Seth then did something rather extraordinary. He yanked his code (including <a href="https://github.com/sethvargo/chef-sugar">chef-sugar</a>) from GitHub and RubyGems. This resulted in many production systems going offline across the globe. We could see some metrics about impact in a lawsuit at some point. When DM’ing Seth early Friday AM he told me, “It’s almost certain that Chef is going to sue.” <a href="https://chrisshort.net/seth-vargo-says-hell-noputs-chef-on-ice/">Read More →</a>

1. [Open letter to the Free Software Foundation Board of Directors](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/open-letter-free-software-foundation-board-directors)

    
1. [Linus Torvalds on the kernel development community](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/799219/cfc5362a1bf6bc5a/)

     Some pretty interesting nuggets in here. “Torvalds responded that he doesn’t even check for presence in linux-next early in the merge window; he is happy enough to get an early pull request that nothing more is required. As the merge window approaches its end, though, he does start checking, and absence from linux-next (earlier in the merge window) can result in pull requests not being acted upon.”
1. [On the occasion of leaving Google](https://medium.com/@Irenes/on-the-occasion-of-leaving-google-b8c7029c8d8b)

     ”This isn’t really a ‘why I’m leaving’ post. You all know many of the reasons, and I do believe retaliation occurred. This is a ‘what you should do about it’ post.”

     ConvertKit released a post about their AWS bill. Cloud economist, Corey Quinn, analyzes how ConvertKit could cut $64,000 a month from their AWS bill.
1. [Software Architecture is Overrated, Clear and Simple Design is Underrated](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-architecture-is-overrated/)

     What’s wrong with software architecture patterns? “I see them similarly in usefulness as coding design patterns. They can give you ideas on how to improve your code or architecture… I spent a lot of time reading and comprehending the Gang of four design patterns, they’ve had far less impact on becoming a better coder than the feedback I’ve gotten from other engineers on my code.”
1. [DevOps terms: 10 advanced concepts to know](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/9/devops-terms-10-advanced)

     ”Are you moving farther down the path with DevOps and tripping on the lingo? Experts explain key DevOps terms and phrases that teams should understand”
1. [Kubernetes’ next step could be to try orchestrating everything else](https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-next-step-could-be-to-try-orchestrating-everything-else/)

     We already see this with OpenShift, Project Pacific, and Google Anthos. The concepts of Kubernetes as the control plane for damn near everything will eventually feed back into vanilla Kubernetes in due time. Keep in mind, spinning up a small Kubernetes cluster to provision and install a larger cluster is a common Kubernetes pattern.
1. [The New Target That Enables Ransomware Hackers to Paralyze Dozens of Towns and Businesses at Once](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-new-target-that-enables-ransomware-hackers-to-paralyze-dozens-of-towns-and-businesses-at-once)

1. [Kubernetes 1.16: Custom Resources, Overhauled Metrics, and Volume Extensions](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/09/18/kubernetes-1-16-release-announcement/)

     I hope y’all are ready for the CRD tsunami because here it comes! Thank you so much to the 1.16 release team! Y’all did a really amazing job.
1. [Deprecated APIs Removed In 1.16: Here’s What You Need To Know](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/)

     Instead of NetworkPolicy use networking.k8s.io/v1. PodSecurityPolicy is now in policy/v1beta1. DaemonSet, Deployment, StatefulSet, and ReplicaSet are now part of apps/v1. Ingress is moving to networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 in Kubernetes 1.20, which should be released this time next year.

     Install OpenShift in a restricted environment with limited access to the Internet.
1. [What to Know About VMware’s Project PacificPhoton OS](https://thenewstack.io/5-things-to-know-about-vmwares-project-pacific/)

     It’s a single control plane for everything from VMs to Kubernetes clusters to pods (yes, pods). Kubernetes Scheduler and Kubelet have been replaced by a Supervisor Cluster and Spherelet (“a proprietary version of Kubelet”). A concept called Native Pods is a thing to be aware of. Oh and . Analysis: This is a lot. VMware is going to have to get implemented and scaled up quickly. If VMware wants to gather a greater than 10% share of the container orchestration market, speedy execution is key.
1. [What’s Going on with GKE and Anthos?DevOps README.md](https://bravenewgeek.com/whats-going-on-with-gke-and-anthos/)

     Google Anthos is a little bit of an oddity at the moment. Yes, Google Cloud admits it has an enterprise problem to an extent. Using the Google Cloud UI is smart as it keeps customer experience consistent and codebases to a minimum. But, while Google Anthos helps Google Cloud’s enterprise problem, it isn’t a lot of actual stuff you can kick the tires on. Their configuration management tool is a git repo with a Kubernetes Operator watching for changes (which is fine). Their control plane is GKE which is also fine. But, the marketing around Google Anthos feels more like a pitch for Site Reliability Engineering as a business model. This is okay too. But, keep in mind, in  (back in 2017) I call out Google SRE as, “proof setting a pile of money on fire is a viable solution to engineering problems.” I’m wondering how many people will buy Google Anthos and end up with large consulting contracts as a result.

     ”Intel engineer Feng Tang spoke at this week’s Linux Plumbers Conference in Lisbon, Portugal on how the Clear Linux team managed to boot their kernel faster. They started out with around a three second kernel boot time but cut it down to just 300 ms.”
1. [deajan/osync](https://github.com/deajan/osync)

1. [Highly Effective Kubernetes Deployments with GitOps](https://medium.com/@timfpark/highly-effective-kubernetes-deployments-with-gitops-c7a0354f1446)

     ”In a GitOps based deployment, a pod running in the cluster watches a specific git repo that contains the set of resource manifests that should be running in the cluster.”
1. [IBM will soon launch a 53-qubit quantum computerquantumbongs.com](https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/ibm-will-soon-launch-a-53-qubit-quantum-computer/)

     I think it looks like a bong personally. But, after talking to a few folks at IBM, I am really impressed with the strides being made in this space. Also, I bought  in case that takes off.
