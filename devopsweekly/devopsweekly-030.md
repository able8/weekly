## [DevOps'ish 030](https://devopsish.com/030) - Sun Jul 2, 2017

Summer in Michigan is pretty interesting. Every lake with houses near it seems to have a fireworks display. There’s been fireworks displays since Monday. My poor dog, Sunny, is terrified of fireworks so this weekend we’re holing up in the basement. She’s heard a few pops today and is happily down here beside me snoozing.

The world of <strong>DevOps</strong> is running full bore. Microsoft is making big moves. Kubernetes marches forward. Let’s Encrypt crossed a major milestone. Ubuntu is being shady. The NSA, Intel, and Verizon are all being naughty. Oh… And Detroit is still awesome. <a href="http://app.jobvite.com/m?3ru8KiwA">You should consider working with me</a>. Let’s get to this week’s DevOps news!
