## [DevOps'ish 103](https://devopsish.com/103) - Sun Nov 25, 2018

This week was Thanksgiving in the US. It was a holiday and I unplugged to a certain extent. I played games on my phone instead of working on various things and reading research. I took a little bit of a mental break the second half of this week (and I hope you did too if you could). This week, while most of the tech world is Las Vegas, I’ll be the designated survivor in an undisclosed location (aka Westford, Massachusetts). re:Invent is too big for me and too soft of a target for my frayed whatever you want to call it (nerves, anxiety, etc.). Have a great week!
