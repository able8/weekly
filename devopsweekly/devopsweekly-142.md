## [DevOps'ish 142](https://devopsish.com/142) - Sun Aug 25, 2019

I wrote something this week on Twitter that I’d like to dive a little deeper into. “I see Kubernetes as an opportunity for Ops folks to reach across the DevOps divides and help Devs understand what concepts Ops has wrangled with every day around DNS, networking, infrastructure, etc. Kubernetes is a tool that could improve collaboration along logical boundaries.”

Google’s SRE culture influenced their use of containers and vice versa. Kubernetes is an output of that container use and culture. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that a tool built from an SRE culture by container wielding engineers ends up helping that culture grow and spread. I’ve long said SRE is the metrification of DevOps. But, what Kubernetes can enable in an organization is a singular way in which they orchestrate.

Devs have long wondered why Ops can’t move faster. Ops is giving Developers this platform, Kubernetes. Developers might be struggling with the bits that Ops has been managing for a while now. Things like DNS, TLS certificates, security, or governance aren’t trivial at scale in any organization. Kubernetes <del>enables</del> forces Development and Operations to collaborate in ways we wouldn’t without it. Ops would be wise not to beat their chest. Devs would be prudent to ask Ops for help. Remember to be humble and that you’re all working towards the same goals (hopefully).

### People

1. [For Young Female Coders, Internship Interviews Can Be Toxic](https://www.wired.com/story/for-young-female-coders-internship-interviews-can-be-toxic/)

     ”According to a Girls Who Code survey, many young women, whom the tech industry is counting on to diversify its heavily male workforce, are put off by their first encounters with tech companies.”
1. [WeWTF](https://www.profgalloway.com/wewtf)

     WeWork CEO, Adam Neumann, is mentioned 169 times in their S1. This is such a trainwreck.

     Speaking of trainwrecks, Oracle’s board just approved a lawsuit against Oracle’s founder and CEO. The NetSuite deal might have been too sweet. Larry Ellison owned NetSuite when Oracle acquired it.
1. [Trump Administration Brief Asks Supreme Court To Allow Firing Workers For Being Gay](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/dominicholden/trump-scotus-gay-workers)

     A lot of FUD around this one but, if your project or product is written in Go, you should have seen updates for them too potentially. If you didn’t, check if your vendor/project is being as responsible as the Kubernetes community is.

     ”COBOL was a giant leap for computers to make industries more efficient. Chris Short describes how learning COBOL was seen as a safe long-term bet. Sixty years later, there are billions of lines of COBOL code that can’t easily be replaced—and few specialists who know the language. Ritika Trikha explains that something must change: Either more people must learn COBOL, or the industries that rely on it have to update their codebase. Both choices are difficult. But the future isn’t being written in COBOL. Today’s IT infrastructure is built in the cloud—and a lot of it is written in Go. Carmen Hernández Andoh shares how Go’s designers wanted a language more suited for the cloud. And Kelsey Hightower points out that languages are typically hyper-focused for one task. But they’re increasingly open and flexible.”
