## [DevOps'ish 186](https://devopsish.com/186) - Sun Oct 4, 2020

This is the hell that is America today: It took us a week to get a legitimate COVID-19 test for my daughter. Strep and flu tests were done at the same time; she tested positive for the flu. Hopefully, things are on the upswing there.

Just when that turned around for good, I went for a walk to take a break from the stressors of day to day life. Then out of nowhere, Sunny and I were attacked by an irresponsible neighbor’s dog. Immediately taking down the attacking dog resulted in me skinning and bruising my left knee. Then the neighbors didn’t want to take responsibility because we walked up the sidewalk. Can’t I walk up the sidewalk now? I don’t have time for stupid. I’ve never seen this dog before. I’ve lived in this neighborhood for three years. A neighbor that witnessed the whole thing confided in me that the same dog attacked his dog a while back and put it in the hospital.

Sunny luckily got off unscathed (defending her as a human shield was second nature). I got the cops involved, though, which is something I hate doing. But, the lack of responsibility taken and the fact this isn’t a first forced my hand.

My mental health needs a break. I need an average week for once.

    One lone hero in production is not sustainable-not for you, not for high-functioning teams, and not for customers who depend on your service. Collaborate well by instrumenting observability from the very beginning, and enable more resilient teams to build more reliable systems sustainably.
