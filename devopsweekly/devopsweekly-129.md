## [DevOps'ish 129](https://devopsish.com/129) - Sun May 26, 2019

The end of May looms large on the horizon and a busy June is ahead for a lot of us. This is about that time of year I wish it were the holiday season. It’s hot, people’s patience wears down faster, and there is always something to do. Here are some tips for the days ahead:

I’ll be in Durham, NC 28-30 May and Raleigh 3-7 June. If you want to get together in the coming weeks, let me know. Stay safe out there and don’t forget to drink water.

     Abby Fuller played defense for AWS community involvement. Rough. It’s not always about flash and swag. Sometimes there are folks that have to get shit done.

     I mentioned it earlier this week but, I’m legit thinking of switching to an ultra lightweight, 4 (actual) Core PC running Fedora because of the performance my 2018 MacBook Air has taken. There were shortcuts in keeping up with Moore’s Law and our backs and wallets are going to pay the price for it. I’m open to suggestions for a new daily driver. But, it needs to comparable in weight to a MacBook Air (and not Huawei; more on that in next week’s newsletter).
