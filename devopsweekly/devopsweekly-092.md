## [DevOps'ish 092](https://devopsish.com/092) - Sun Sep 9, 2018

Elon Musk is a weird dude. Amidst <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/business/tesla-musk-sec-subpoena-goldman.html">the SEC probing into his tweet</a> about taking Tesla private, ol’ Elon decides to <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/07/technology/elon-musk-joe-rogan/index.html">smoke a blunt on a podcast with Joe Rogan</a> (the memes are amazing by the way). Not the smartest move. The only thing dumber that happened this week was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/jack-dorsey-alex-jones-photo/">Alex Jones at the US Capitol</a> accosting Jack Dorsey. Did you know <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-heart-rate-spiked-hearings-congress-2018-9">Dorsey fasts every day</a>? Alex Jones is so dumb, he pisses off hangry people. What a maroon. The one person that said <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90215581/twitters-jack-dorsey-defends-decision-to-keep-alex-jones">keep Alex Jones</a> on the platform doesn’t eat during the day and Jones pisses him off. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/09/06/twitter-has-permanently-banned-alex-jones-infowars/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.ebdc392abea3">The moron got banned that day</a>. What a weird week.

In other news, two incredibly close and amazing friends of ours (both were in Julie and I’s wedding) will be participating in the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s Light the Night 2018. They have done this year after year regardless of what was going on in their worlds. To quote our friend Kim, “This year will be extra special because we have a new nextdoor neighbor, Maya (3rd grade), who is a leukemia survivor and she will be joining our team and walking with us! 2 survivors on 1 team! Both Sara and Maya’s family speak at length about how amazing LLS was to them during their treatments and how LLS continues to be a beacon of hope for so many.”

They turn it into a healthy competition pitting wife (Kim) against husband (Chris). As I’m writing this, Chris is getting shellacked in the donation department. If you are able, please contribute. I will be matching confirmed contributions made by DevOps’ish readers (up to $200). Please forward your receipts to me by 2018-09-24.
