## [DevOps'ish 064](https://devopsish.com/064) - Sun Feb 25, 2018

I’m fresh off the plane from <a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-charlotte/welcome/">DevOpsDays Charlotte 2018</a> when I’m writing this. I have to say a HUGE thank you to the organizers, sponsors, and speakers. <a href="https://twitter.com/editingemily/status/966735443436941317">The venue was beyond amazing</a>. Red Ventures knows how to host a crowd in style. I definitely feel like I need to fly out the morning after these events though. Traveling on a Friday is not ideal. It never fails that I end up missing a connection I wanted to make because I just flat out ran out of time. DevOps is a lot of things. I categorize this newsletter (and DevOps as a whole) into People, Process, and Tools. That is the order of importance; people come first. Always.
