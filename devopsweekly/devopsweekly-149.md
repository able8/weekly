## [DevOps'ish 149](https://devopsish.com/149) - Sun Oct 13, 2019

This week’s introduction is brought to you by <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig">Corey Quinn</a>. Send complaints Corey’s way:

What’s made of comfy ring-spun cotton, available in your size and shape, AND guaranteed to start a flame war with your AWS pals? The 2019 Last Week in AWS Charity T-Shirt! This year’s shirts come in two flavors — one for each pronunciation of the acronym for Amazon Machine Images. Are you an Ahh-Me or an Ay-Em-Eye? Pick your preference, and wear it loud and proud!

As usual, all proceeds from these shirts go directly to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which has helped increase the <em>survival rate of childhood cancer from 20% to over 80%</em>. Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing, or food.

Now you can wear your inside joke on your chest, and your heart on your sleeve all at the same time. Visit <a href="https://snark.cloud/charityshirt?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=devopsish&amp;utm_campaign=149">https://snark.cloud/charityshirt</a> to buy your shirt today!

<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: The Short family is on vacation. DevOps’ish 150 will likely be a beautiful picture.

Due to this, K8S is slowly becoming a mainstream cloud operating system. However, when it comes to handling storage for applications, specifically stateful applications, you have to do some research.”
