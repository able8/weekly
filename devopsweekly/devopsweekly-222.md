## [DevOps'ish 222](https://devopsish.com/222) - Sun Jun 13, 2021

I want to point out a few signs that I think we‚Äôre pushing the industry too hard, too fast. <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1403100781646028808">Fires in AWS data centers</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/numerous-popular-websites-are-facing-an-outage/">Fastly (the CDN) took an hour-long outage</a> triggered by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/09/fastly-says-single-customer-triggered-bug-that-caused-mass-outage">customer finding a bug</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/0cvlzpvwg251">Cloudflare had outages in Chicago and Los Angeles</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/08/ransomware-human-impact/">Ransomware is running through companies</a> like Grant went through Richmond (to the point the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-06-03/ransomware-targeted-by-justice-department-as-attacks-flourish">US Justice department is equating them, in some ways, to terrorist attacks</a>).

Things need to change. Moving towards a more hybrid and fluid environment is not just a strategic priority; it‚Äôs survival at this point. Then making sure that your entire business can‚Äôt grind to a halt because lowest common denominator security issues happen. I thought we figured it out in the early 2000s. But, technology has changed so much since then, and there are new zero-days every day. We‚Äôre in a very tight position as technologists. If you‚Äôre a developer, you‚Äôre a target. If you‚Äôre an employee, you‚Äôre a target. You and every service you touch is a target. Nothing is safe.
