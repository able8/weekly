## [DevOps'ish 065](https://devopsish.com/065) - Sun Mar 4, 2018

At what point are we going to admit that, like mainframes and COBOL, while history is worth remembering it might not be worth memorializing. Change is a constant in life that we cannot deny. Humanity wouldn‚Äôt be roaming the earth and stars if it weren‚Äôt for evolution, which at its base is change. Throughout history there have been points in time in which one side said, ‚Äúno more‚Äù and the other said, ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù. Much like those in your organization that resist change because, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always done it this way.‚Äù You and your allies must say, ‚Äúno more‚Äù for the betterment of yourself, your team, and your organization. Cast off the past, remember it but do not grip on to it for dear life. Do this to not only improve things around you but to advance civilization as a whole.
