## [DevOps'ish 029](https://devopsish.com/029) - Sun Jun 25, 2017

My first full week working as Manager, DevOps at Bankrate.com in Downtown Detroit was great! There is an amazing transformation happening here in Detroit. I foresee Detroit becoming a huge tech hub and DevOps center of gravity in the not too distant future. If you are interested in joining this effort and building a world class DevOps team at Bankrate.com <a href="http://app.jobvite.com/m?3ru8KiwA">I am looking to fill one more DevOps Engineer position</a> on my team at the moment.

I also had the pleasure of hearing <a href="https://twitter.com/jbaruch">Baruch Sadogursky</a> from <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/">JFrog</a> talk about <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/shownotes/devops-scale-greek-tragedy-3-acts-devops-detroit/">DevOps Transformation</a> at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Detroit/">DevOps Detroit</a>. The talk had a great theme (Greek tragedies) and walked through the stereotypical DevOps greenfield scenario. Two things Baruch said really stood out to me. “Pain is instructional.” It is very unlikely you are going to go from startup to Google/Facebook/Netflix in the span of a few weeks, months, or years. The growing pains that will be unique to your organization and applications are incredibly helpful in guiding you towards your goals.

Baruch also addressed the DevOps as a job title or department in a way that resonated with me, “DevOps Engineers are DevOps enablers in their organizations.” This is so true! When DevOps tries to be the entire organization’s culture from day one it will fail. You have to get some buy-in and start. The whole organization will transform iteratively in small, manageable pieces (just like in our workflows). I have come to learn that DevOps is as much about patience as it is speed and flow.
