## [DevOps'ish 163](https://devopsish.com/163) - Sun Jan 19, 2020

Got a jam-packed newsletter this week, complete with relevant stories from The Washington Post and New York Times. It’s an exciting time to be alive. I remember when something had to be earth-shattering to make these papers. Nowadays, it seems commonplace to read about low level, tech news (like the .org registry issues), and high stakes tech news all the same (like the NSA disclosing a Windows vuln). But, what these two stories this week highlight is the importance of governance. In one case, there is seemingly poor governance. In the other case, there is potentially the saving of billions of dollars of economic impact. Hopefully, we can somehow save the .org registry in the same way the NSA helped Microsoft this week.

     ”One reason for its varying acceptance is that its benefits are not immediately obvious, it pays off more in the medium- and long-term.

However, in our experience, pair programming is vital for collaborative teamwork and high quality software.”
