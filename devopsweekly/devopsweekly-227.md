## [DevOps'ish 227](https://devopsish.com/227) - Sun Jul 18, 2021

I was struck with a very mild case of heat exhaustion a couple of weeks ago after standing over a hot grill hosting our family’s 4th of July party. So when the article “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/10/1028172/climate-change-human-body-extreme-heat-survival/">How hot is too hot for the human body?</a>” came across my desk this week, I was uniquely interested in it. I’ve run several miles in the Middle East, the high plains of Colorado, Florida, the jungles of Honduras, and many points in between. “This shouldn’t impact me like it is.” I thought.

Why is heat such a deadly factor in cooler climates? Why did I get slammed by this one hot day? I discovered, “While most researchers agree that a wet-bulb temperature of 95 °F is unlivable for most humans, the reality is that less extreme conditions can be deadly too. We’ve only hit those wet-bulb temperatures on Earth a few times, but heat kills people around the world every year.”

Oh… “Residents of cooler places are also just less acclimatized to the heat, so wet-bulb temperatures below 95 °F can be deadly.”

Not only that, “Heat acclimatization builds up over time: It can start in as little as a few days, and the whole process can take six weeks or longer.” That likely means that the year-plus spent here in Michigan (with lower than average temps this summer) has made me uniquely suited for a blast of heat being more impactful than ever before.
It’s an interesting, potentially life-saving <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/10/1028172/climate-change-human-body-extreme-heat-survival/">article</a>.

    “The exact nature of the disruption is unclear, but the outage affected both passenger and cargo transportation services.” This is interesting because after Stuxnet, Iran went to some lengths to disconnect critical services from the internet unless necessary. I wouldn’t be surprised if this were an intelligence operation but, it has a slight dissident feel to it too.
