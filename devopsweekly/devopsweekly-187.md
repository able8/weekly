## [DevOps'ish 187](https://devopsish.com/187) - Sun Oct 11, 2020

Normally, I don’t like to highlight military uses of Kubernetes (people have feelings about that; I do too, for that matter). But, this week, something rather significant happened out in Utah: <a href="https://www.hill.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2375297/u-2-federal-lab-achieves-flight-with-kubernetes/">U-2 Federal Lab achieves flight with Kubernetes</a>. “The U-2 Federal Laboratory successfully leveraged Kubernetes during a local training sortie on a U-2 Dragon Lady assigned to the 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base, Sept. 22. This represents the first time Kubernetes has flown on an operational major weapon system in the Department of Defense.”

Yes, OpenShift and Kubernetes are in use in ground systems across the US Department of Defense. But, I’ve not heard of Kubernetes running on actual airframes until this week. The fact the team on the U-2 did this is quite stunning. Remember, U-2s were critical intelligence gathering sources on overflight missions during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a> <strong><em>in 1962</em></strong>.

The U-2 program is a very old and sensitive program to the US government. As high and overarching as my clearances were, I never got close to the U-2 program (compartmentalization works). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_U-2">The U-2</a> is a critical <a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/c4isr/">C4ISR platform</a> used in humanitarian and war fighting missions the globe over. The fact the U-2 program is leaning forward with containers and cloud native thinking makes me ask the same question I asked folks about <a href="https://youtu.be/eKOGQKHOBNg?t=655">DevOps and the US nuclear weapons program</a>. “If they can do it, why can’t you?”

    I’ve been working from home non-stop for two years and had several jobs that allowed for it prior to that. Your home office is something you have to invest in making a space you enjoy and appreciate. I need to do a lot of work and flip things on my desk at some point so I can get more natural lighting in my field of view. It’s just the next thing on the list. After that, there will be something small I can do to improve things. You don’t get a dope setup overnight unless you win the lottery.

In a September 30 blog post, the organization behind the Firefox web browser warned that “the internet needs our love”. While there is lots to celebrate about the internet, it is increasingly under threat from various types of bad actors, so Mozilla is starting a campaign to try to push back against those threats.” Mozilla in trying to .

    ”‘Now is the right time to create two market-leading companies focused on what they do best,’ said IBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna in a statement. ‘IBM will focus on its open hybrid cloud platform and AI [artificial intelligence] capabilities. NewCo will have greater agility to design, run and modernize the infrastructure of the world’s most important organizations.‘” When I boss called me and asked if I’d heard the news that morning I said no. After he told me, I asked if there was an email announcement? He said, “Dude, it’s IBM. Check the internet.” To my credit, I was in the process of making coffee. But, that’s a very valid point. If Red Hat did this, no one would care. IBM does it and it’s a sea change.

    Two wonderful comics from  this week I’d like to highlight:
1. [Download today: Kubernetes security ebook - tips, tricks, best practicesDownload this ebook](https://security.stackrox.com/kubernetes-security-ebook-tips-tricks-best-practices.html?Source=DevOpsish&LSource=DevOpsish)

    The rapid adoption of Kubernetes to manage containerized workloads is driving great efficiencies in application development, deployment, and scalability. However, when security becomes an afterthought, you risk diminishing the greatest gain of containerization - agility.  to learn how to (1) build secure images and prevent untrusted/vulnerable code, (2) configure RBAC, network policies, and runtime privileges, (3) detect unauthorized runtime activity, and (4) secure your Kubernetes infrastructure components such as the API server.

1. [Continuous Availability and Active-Active Bucket Replication](https://blog.min.io/active-active-replication/)

    “One of the key requirements driving enterprises towards cloud-native object storage platforms is the ability to consume storage in a multi-data center setup. Multiple data centers provide resilient, highly available storage clusters, capable of withstanding the complete failure of one or more of those data centers. Multi-data center support brings private and hybrid cloud infrastructure closer to how the public cloud providers architect their services to achieve high levels of resilience.”
