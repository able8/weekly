     “Like the click baity title? Nice! Now let’s talk about the ‘glamorous’ conference life.” I can definitely relate to everything in this. I don’t cry myself to sleep though. That stopped long, long ago. Don’t get me wrong, I’m very fortunate to be able to travel. But, I’m also fortunate enough to know I need to say no more (still).

1. [Ooof! Cisco Webex has been down for 7 hours – and counting](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/25/cisco_webex_down_outage/)

     I almost took a job at AppDynamics once. One of the reasons I decided to stop pursuing that opportunity was horrible interviews due to WebEx. If I have to use a tool every day to work, it needs to get through the interviews okay.

1. [Former Google CEO predicts the internet will split in two — and one part will be led by China](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/20/eric-schmidt-ex-google-ceo-predicts-internet-split-china.html)

     To be honest, I think this has already happened. While the Internet is still whole it’s nearly impossible for a Chinese citizen to legally see anything outside of what China allows. Foreign businesses also can’t wholly own their presence in China and must use a partner (who is likely in bed with government). This isn’t a matter of if when the split occurs but whether or not that split will speed up or not.
