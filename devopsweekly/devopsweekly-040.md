## [DevOps'ish 040](https://devopsish.com/040) - Sun Sep 10, 2017

This week I finished a project that has been in the works for a quite some time. Back before I moved to Detroit but shortly after taking over <a href="https://tridevops.com/">Triangle DevOps</a>, I was offered (and accepted) a spot as a <a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-raleigh/welcome/">DevOpsDays Raleigh</a> organizer. I submitted three talks to the event and one was accepted. Today I opened the event with my talk, “<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/chrisshort/the-dark-side-of-devops">The Dark Side of DevOps</a>” and thoroughly enjoyed it as well as all the other talks at the event. Huge shout out to the other organizers, volunteers, and speakers for all their hard work in making the second DevOpsDays Raleigh better than the first one. It was great to catch up with friends while I was in town. Back to Detroit for me but what a week for news in general and DevOps!

1. [In Search of a Secure Time Sourceexpiration times like HSTS](https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/890-In-Search-of-a-Secure-Time-Source.html)

     All our computers and smartphones have an internal clock and need to know the current time. As configuring the time manually is annoying it’s common to set the time via Internet services. What tends to get forgotten is that a reasonably accurate clock is often a crucial part of security features like certificate lifetimes or features with . Thus the timesetting should be secure — but usually it isn’t.
