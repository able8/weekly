## [DevOps'ish 226](https://devopsish.com/226) - Sun Jul 11, 2021

If you <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort">follow me on Twitter</a> you know I‚Äôve had a hard time with stable internet this week. Co-workers asking about my absence, I appreciate you. Sorry, y‚Äôall, sometimes everything breaks at once. But then today I get this when working on something newsletter related.

Y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt.

Then it got worse. I won‚Äôt go into details but, let‚Äôs just say it was the cherry on top of a shit week for tech but otherwise good week here at home.

1. [Don‚Äôt Ban ‚ÄúPolitics‚Äù at Work](https://hbr.org/2021/07/dont-ban-politics-at-work)

    Your politics is my everyday life. ‚ÄúWith political polarization on the rise and companies gauging the risks of employees‚Äô internal political activism, some are opting to ban political speech at work entirely. The authors, experts in speaking up at work, explain the pitfalls of this approach and instead suggest asking a different question: How can we support employees and encourage them to handle difference, respect one another, listen, and learn? The answer, they suggest, requires four actions on the part of leaders: Building empathy and respect for others‚Äô views, inviting different perspectives into the leadership fold, accepting mistakes gracefully, and teaching people how to disagree.‚Äù
