## [DevOps'ish 172](https://devopsish.com/172) - Sun Mar 22, 2020

There is <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4h4db5">a line in Saving Private Ryan about griping</a>. There’s a chain of command in the military and leadership voices its concerns up the chain, never down it. This week, I’ve been reaching up my chain of command in government to make sure that the people that are supposed to be leading right now are. I would encourage you to do the same. Some good news this week is that after announcing an initiative to harness a global computer network to contribute work towards pharmaceutical drugs to combat COVID-19, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/foldinghome-surpasses-400-000-users-amid-crypto-contribution">Folding@Home has seen a 1200% increase in computers actively contributing to the project</a>. I set up four systems to run Folding@Home this week as part of this effort. But, on Friday, I had to back down to three due to fan noise. I would also encourage you to donate any spare CPU and GPU cycles you have to the project. Together we can beat COVID-19.

Here are three things I’ve done, and will continue to do, with my unique position as a palatable diverse person in tech.”
### Process

1. [Bringing encryption restrictions in through the back door](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/815137/fb7bca4bc7bf5f0b/)

    “EARN IT for short, is an attempt to force online service providers (e.g. Facebook, Google, etc.) to follow a set of ‘best practices’ determined by a commission, to combat the scourge of CSAM; the composition of that commission makes it clear that end-to-end encryption will not be one of those practices, but companies that do not follow the best practices will lose liability protection for their users’ actions. It is, in brief, an attempt to force providers to either abandon true end-to-end encryption or face ruinous lawsuits—all without ‘seeming’ to be about encryption at all.”

    “NASA needs 215 more petabytes of storage by the year 2025, and expects Amazon Web Services to provide the bulk of that capacity. However, the space agency didn’t realize this would cost it plenty in cloud egress charges. As in, it will have to pay as scientists download its data.”
