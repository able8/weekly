## [DevOps'ish 036](https://devopsish.com/036) - Sun Aug 13, 2017

This week has been a trying week for me. I’ve touched almost every facet of what is important to me both personally and professionally. One kid having surgery, another kid catching a cold, moving into our new home, dealing with Veteran’s Affairs, addressing long-time struggles, new talent starting at work, getting things done, threats to friends on the west coast, threats to friends in Guam, Nazis on the east coast, and I did a lot of community work. This week was great on some fronts and very challenging on others. By the time 4:30 PM on Friday rolled around I was cooked. Next week, I’ll be in South Florida bringing a heavy dose of <a href="https://devopsish.com/">DevOps</a> to the Sunshine State.
