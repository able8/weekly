## [DevOps'ish 006](https://devopsish.com/006) - Sun Jan 15, 2017

Welcome to this week‚Äôs edition of <a href="https://devopsish.com/"><strong>DevOps‚Äôish</strong></a> where we cover Dev, Ops, and all the ish in between.

I hope you had a productive week and are looking forward to another productive week ahead!

So much <a href="https://devopsish.com/"><strong>DevOps</strong></a> , so little time.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2017/01/09/atlassian-acquires-popular-team-productivity-app-trello-for-425-million/">Trello was acquired by Atlassian for a whopping $425 million</a>. This is an acquisition that makes a lot of sense for Atlassian. Trello could be used as a sort of gateway drug into the much more complicated Atlassian software products.

<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/01/10/swift-chris-lattner-leaving-apple/">Chris Lattner, the creator of Swift, is leaving Apple and joining the Autopilot team at Tesla</a>. According to a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-apples-culture-of-secrecy-wears-down-its-top-developers-2017-1">Business Insider</a> source, Chris Lattner left because he felt, ‚ÄúHe always felt constrained at Apple in terms of what he could discuss publicly.‚Äù But, <a href="https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/819974025371787264">Chris vehemently denied this report</a> in a tweet saying, ‚ÄúFolk just want to make üçé look bad. üò†‚Äù.

<a href="https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara">Ashley McNamara</a> maintains a ‚Äú<a href="http://ashleymcnamara.github.io/learn_to_code/">Curated list of resources for budding developers</a>‚Äù that is a consolidated treasure trove of language resources.

<a href="https://www.blockloop.io/mastering-bash-and-terminal">blockloop has a good post on bash and the terminal</a>. It‚Äôs pretty basic stuff and a little macOS centric. But, it does discuss my two favorite CLI utilities in macOS: pbcopy and pbpaste.

I don‚Äôt know how I missed this last week but Flickr (yes, Flickr) has a great post about how they <a href="https://code.flickr.net/2017/01/05/a-year-without-a-byte/">tried to go through 2016 without buying new storage systems</a>.

<a href="https://theagileadmin.com/2017/01/10/but-how-can-it-do-devops/">LinkedIn has a vending machine for IT equipment</a> much like factories have vending of parts and PPE. That‚Äôs one way to automate IT functions.

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/12/emc_layoffs/">Dell EMC is planning to layoff a big chunk of its workforce</a> post-merger. The cuts could affect as much as a quarter of Dell EMC employees (that is up to 35,000 people). Insiders say things have been a little awkward inside the company since the beginning of their fiscal Q4.

<a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/releases/tag/v1.12.6">Docker 1.12.6 was released</a> this week to address <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jan/21">CVE-2016‚Äì9962</a>. The <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1012568">vulnerability was pretty gnarly</a>: ‚ÄúrunC passes a file descriptor from the host‚Äôs filesystem to the ‚Äòrunc init‚Äô bootstrap process when joining a container. This allows a malicious process inside a container to gain access to the host
filesystem with its current privilege set.‚Äù <a href="http://rhelblog.redhat.com/2017/01/13/docker-0-day-stopped-cold-by-selinux/">Red Hat demonstrated that SELinux could have saved you</a> from this bug ever happening in your environment.

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/11/ansible_patches_own_the_farm_vulnerability/">Ansible had a pretty gnarly bug announced this week</a>. CVE-2016‚Äì9587 was discovered by <a href="https://www.computest.nl/advisories/CT-2017-0109_Ansible.txt">Computest</a>. According to James Cammarata, Ansible Lead/Sr. Principal Software Engineer, ‚Äú<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-devel/SyrgcUySAIQ">a compromised remote system being managed via Ansible can lead to commands being run on the Ansible controller (as the user running the ansible or ansible-playbook command).</a>‚Äù Multiple release candidates came out during the week. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=footer#!msg/ansible-project/ydfEh11hlXA/eaOPE3p_AQAJ">A stable 2.x release should be coming January 16, 2017</a>. If you are still running Ansible 1.x code, you should upgrade to the 2.1.4 or 2.2.1 release as soon as possible.

There was a great crowd at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Kubernetes-Meetup/">Triangle Kubernetes and OpenShift Meetup</a> this past week. I got some helpful tips from Thomas Wiest about running Kubernetes in AWS. I have made <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AAV9Qz3Q7IhLCqRM05VZbis3oJm6duhVdi0">my notes from the Meetup available</a>.

<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/golang-nuts/tr2ZKSQ42zE">Go 1.8 RC1 was released</a> this past week. The feature I‚Äôm most excited for is a default $GOPATH. I swear every time I install Go I never remember where I put my $GOPATH so the default will lower the bar to entry for newer folk (and help the senile).

The fantastic Hacker News alternative, <a href="https://lobste.rs/">**Lobsters</a>** is having a membership drive of sorts. If you would like an invite just let me know.
