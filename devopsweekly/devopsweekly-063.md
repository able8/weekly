## [DevOps'ish 063](https://devopsish.com/063) - Sun Feb 18, 2018

I listened to a very impactful podcast on Wednesday while walking my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfL1YAenilh/?taken-by=thechrisshort">best buddy beast (happy birthday, Sunny)</a>. On the podcast, the speaker asked the audience five questions. One of those questions was, “When was the last time you changed your mind?” This question struck me. When was the last time I changed my mind? What motivated me to make that change? Would I be able to help others make a similar change should they ask for assistance? My mind raced through a series of events where I felt my mind had changed on something. Some were significant, others were trivial. But, the one thing I realized is that I change my mind often. It goes back to something I’ve mentioned in this newsletter a few times, <strong>resisting change is a DevOps anti-pattern</strong>. It also harkens back to the <a href="../048/">strong opinions, loosely held</a> mantra that I have tried to adapt to. The speaker goes on to mention that being able to change your mind requires you to be humble, confident, and able to listen. Listen as in actually listening not pausing until the other person is done speaking.

So much of technology and working with it and in it involves change. Yet, as technologist and humans, we are terrible at change. We fear the unknown. We resist breaking the status quo. The fact of the matter is that as humans, our adaptability is what keeps us alive. Could the human race survive as long as it has without adapting to new things? No. So please, do not mock the person that tries new ways to do things. Do not chastise someone for getting smart home equipment to turn on lights. Those people are the ones iterating on things in their lives as part of their continuous improvement process. If your goal is to be the best light switch operator in the world then focus on that. Don’t worry about the rest of the world eliminating the need for the light switch altogether. The best people for business are the ones automating themselves out of their job. Keep giving them more stuff to automate. The podcast?

Say what you want about Chuck Rosenberg’s politics, fine. But, you cannot question the leadership style and lessons learned from this podcast.
