## [DevOps'ish 008](https://devopsish.com/008) - Sun Jan 29, 2017

Oh look! There’s a 666 in the epoch this week… Great! But, as one of my co-workers and I always say, we’re going to “will it” to be a good week in <a href="https://devopsish.com/"><strong>DevOps</strong></a> . It usually works out too.

<a href="https://medium.com/@nagarwal/docker-containers-filesystem-demystified-b6ed8112a04a#.y03d2gbvf">Nitin Agarwal breaks down the Docker filesystem</a> (AUFS). It is a rather simplistic presentation. If you know someone struggling with the concepts it’s definitely worth a read.

<a href="https://twitter.com/brendangregg">Brendan Gregg</a> built out a very simple page containing ALL his works on <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/linuxperf.html">Linux Performance</a>. I do not think you could bookmark this page enough.

There is some pretty insane stuff happening in Russia. Some pretty <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/theres-something-very-weird-happening-inside-russias-cyberse?utm_term=.mjeldYBvYv#.soZRp8Yg8g">senior cybersecurity folks are being held by a military tribunal</a>. Keep an eye on this one.

<a href="https://dzone.com/">DZone</a> recently released their <a href="https://dzone.com/guides/devops-continuous-delivery-and-automation">Guide to DevOps: Continuous Delivery and Automation</a>. Lots of cool concepts and stories for you to ponder over.

Did you hear that <a href="http://blog.softlayer.com/2016/softlayer-ibm-bluemix-integration">SoftLayer was handing over the reigns to BlueMix</a>? Me neither (sorry, not sorry). <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/26/ibm_softlayer_having_meltdown/">The transition appears to be going over like a fart in church</a>. Big Blue where are you?

AWS went full on IPv6 this week (kinda). <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-ipv6-update-global-support-spanning-15-regions-multiple-aws-services/">AWS has rolled out IPv6 to a large swath of services</a>. It is remarkable to me that IPv6 is not embraced in the US even now.

We found two annoying bugs this week during our daily DevOps’ing. One bug involved <a href="https://chrisshort.net/gitlab-annoyance-private-to-public-repos/">an issue with the notoriously awful GitLab UI</a>. GitLab has told me they are trying to fix this issue. The other bug was around <a href="https://chrisshort.net/find-ec2-instances-that-are-missing-tags/">AWS’s text formatting</a>. Depending on which region you are querying the formatting can be wildly different.

<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/gopher-academy-launches-training-programs-134500474.html">Gopher Academy is launching training courses</a>. I will be attending the <a href="https://www.bigmarker.com/gopheracademy/Introduction-to-Buffalo-Web-Development-in-Go">Introduction to Buffalo — Web Development in Go</a> on January 31, 2017. Take a look at what is coming up.
