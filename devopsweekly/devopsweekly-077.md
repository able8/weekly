## [DevOps'ish 077](https://devopsish.com/077) - Sun May 27, 2018

I have a lot to talk about this week. I‚Äôm putting sections in the introduction for ease of reading (feel free to skip parts you‚Äôre not mildly interested in). Also, thank you to this week‚Äôs sponsors; <a href="https://www.replicated.com/"><strong>Replicated</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.gocd.org/2018/05/08/continuous-delivery-microservices-test-strategy/"><strong>GoCD</strong></a>!

The highlight of my week was being able to meet 1,400 new friends at <a href="http://chefconf.chef.io/">ChefConf</a> 2018 in Chicago. If you are ever wondering how to run an amazing event, look no further than the good folks at Chef. From a speaker‚Äôs perspective, I have never felt more prepared for a talk. The event itself was meticulously planned and executed. I presented my talk, <em>DevOps is Not War</em> to a standing room only audience. Thanks to the fantastic guidance from the conference‚Äôs speaking coach, <a href="http://messageglue.com/">Anna Boynton</a>, I was able to take a forty minute talk and land it perfectly inside the twenty-minute time slot I had. The event morphed my bias of Chef from a niche tool to a formidable accompaniment of software to ease automation tasks. The messages from the keynotes were like those I‚Äôve delivered to many audiences before, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not an X company, you‚Äôre a technology company.‚Äù I highly recommend adding ChefConf 2019 to your schedules as soon as it is announced.

I won‚Äôt <del>bore</del> annoy you with more GDPR news. But, I do have one ask from readers: What do you want to know about the data gathered by this newsletter and accompanying web site? I think GDPR is important but, I have not changed much to implement it (and I‚Äôm not really sure if I need to either). With that being said, I present to you the <a href="https://gdprhallofshame.com/">üëé GDPR Hall of Shame</a>.

There were two announcements this week from the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> community that merit attention: one is good, the other is disconcerting. First, Go has adopted a new <a href="https://golang.org/conduct">Code of Conduct</a> (based on Google‚Äôs new <a href="https://opensource.google.com/docs/releasing/template/CODE_OF_CONDUCT/">Code of Conduct template</a>) Go‚Äôs new Code of Conduct now applies to community members working in non-Go community spaces. This change is a good thing. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to prey on people in a community outside of that community‚Äôs space and expect to have your standing in the community protected. This allows for open secrets to be acted upon (and I feel transparency is good).

Sadly, this good news was offset by something that I‚Äôm deeply concerned about in the Go community. You may recall at GopherCon 2017, <a href="https://youtu.be/5LtMb090AZI">Sam Boyer gave a keynote</a> stating that <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep"><strong>dep</strong></a> was the ‚Äúofficial experiment‚Äù for Go package management. According to <a href="https://codeengineered.com/blog/2018/golang-godep-to-vgo/">Matt Farina</a> at the very same GopherCon, ‚ÄúRuss Cox, the current lead of the Go team, came to the table. He made a comment that he could do better if he went off on his own and built something. That something was later announced as vgo.‚Äù This indicates that dep literally had no chance at being the official anything for Go. Russ Cox announced on 2018-04-25 that the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24301#issuecomment-384349642">vgo proposal has been accepted</a>. Sam Boyer is a friend. I know he has spent countless hours working on dep as well as analyzing vgo. Sam has several articles in progress analyzing vgo; <a href="https://sdboyer.io/vgo/intro/">An Analysis of Vgo</a> and <a href="https://sdboyer.io/vgo/failure-modes/">Failure Modes</a> have already been published.

My concern as a somewhat outsider looking in, as well as others I‚Äôve talked to in the Go community, is not in the solution itself but how the communication has been handled. Why announce dep as even a remote possibility as the one way forward at GopherCon 2017? Why was Russ the proposer, writer, and approver of something that clearly needed more debate? I understand Go is a Google project but, this seems rather dictatorial. It‚Äôs not a good look for Go‚Äôs core maintainers (to say the least). My worry is that this could hurt a young and growing community. I would hate to see that. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Go!

It is Memorial Day weekend here in the US. One thing we veterans get mildly irritated about is when citizens don‚Äôt recognize the difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day. Remember this: <strong>we remember the fallen on Memorial Day. We thank veterans on Veterans Day</strong>.
