I was going to discuss this lengthy piece but, give it a read instead: <a href="https://tylerjewell.substack.com/p/the-developer-led-landscape-20-08-28">The Developer-Led Landscape</a>.

    The rapid adoption of Kubernetes to manage containerized workloads is driving great efficiencies in application development, deployment, and scalability. However, when security becomes an afterthought, you risk diminishing the greatest gain of containerization - agility.  to learn how to (1) build secure images and prevent untrusted/vulnerable code, (2) configure RBAC, network policies, and runtime privileges, (3) detect unauthorized runtime activity, and (4) secure your Kubernetes infrastructure components such as the API server.

    ‚ÄúI‚Äôm frustrated. A major service of AWS is broken for 24 days. The Simple Notification Service (SNS) delivers messages to HTTPS subscriptions with a delay of more than 30 minutes. That issue impacts our SaaS business. But AWS did not fix the problem yet and did not even reveal an ETA for resolving the issue.‚Äù And no one I reached out to at AWS has said a damn thing in response to me. Not a good look, y‚Äôall.
