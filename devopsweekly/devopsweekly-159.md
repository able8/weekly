### People

1. [Building Compassion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6qOweQtqTg)

    ¬†I cried really hard. It would mean the world to me if you watched Julia Ferraioli talk about what she lives with every second of every day. I have peripheral nerve damage. I cannot even fathom what Julia is dealing with (and is successful in spite of it).
1. [5 interview questions every Kubernetes job candidate should know](https://opensource.com/article/19/12/kubernetes-interview-questions)

     ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre interviewing people for Kubernetes-related roles, here‚Äôs what to ask and why it matters.‚Äù
1. [DevOps for Dummies (PodCTL)](https://podcasts.apple.com/by/podcast/devops-for-dummies/id1270983443?i=1000460425906)

    ¬†I talk with Emily Freeman, author of DevOps for Dummies, about the biggest challenges faced in cloud adoption and DevOps culture changes.
1. [How to actually get good at basic DevOps if i‚Äôm not already hired (/r/devops)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/e9nl05/how_to_actually_get_good_at_basic_devops_if_im/)

    ¬†The general advice is to get some Raspberry Pis and start hacking on them. This is exactly how I learned Ansible in an evening. I‚Äôve also taught myself a lot about Kubernetes and containers by using Kubernetes on Raspberry Pis. It‚Äôs good to know I‚Äôm not alone in this thinking. If there‚Äôs not enough budget for Raspberry Pis, you could always use KVM or Vagrant.
1. [Ann Arbor & Detroit Rated Top U.S. Tech & Startup Hubs To Watch](https://cronicle.press/2019/12/13/ann-arbor-detroit-rated-top-u-s-tech-startup-hubs-to-watch/)

    ¬†A lot of brilliant people live and work here in Michigan. Energy prices are fairly low too. Lots of open space for data centers too. It feels like half the Kubernetes community in the US lives here. It makes a lot of sense.
1. [India shuts down internet once again, this time in Assam and Meghalaya](https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/13/internet-shutdown-india-assam-meghalaya/)

    ¬†I hate hearing about internet shutdowns.
1. [The top 15 emerging jobs of 2020, according to LinkedIn](https://qz.com/work/1764751/the-top-15-emerging-jobs-of-2020-according-to-linkedin/)

     Cloud engineer, SRE, and JavaScript devs all make the list among some other notables.
### Process

1. [Google reportedly wants to be top-two player in cloud by 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/google-reportedly-wants-to-be-top-two-player-in-cloud-by-2023.html)

    ¬†It should come as a surprise to absolutely no one that Google has high goals for new projects they launch. They also set goals and timelines like any other company. However, the fact Google is known for killing products people actually use (and some employees think it‚Äôs going to happen) makes this one all too real feeling. Not a good look for Google.
1. [Google denies report it considered quitting cloud computing business](https://siliconangle.com/2019/12/17/google-denies-report-considered-quitting-cloud-computing-business/)

    ¬†Of course, Google didn‚Äôt like being called a spade. ‚ÄúGoogle told SiliconANGLE in an emailed statement that The Information‚Äôs report is ‚Äòsimply not accurate‚Äô and linked to several blog posts detailing its investments in cloud-related infrastructure and sales teams.‚Äù
1. [Google Cloud is (Probably) Here to Stay](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/google-cloud-is-probably-here-to-stay/)

    ¬†I‚Äôm a GCP customer so I hope they stay around but, I can use other clouds, I don‚Äôt have to use GCP. Some folks‚Äô whole businesses are on GCP. To pull the plug on that overnight would be some pretty horrific press. Corey Quinn thinks Google is here for the long haul.
1. [Nginx‚Äôs office is being searched due to Rambler Group‚Äôs lawsuit. The complaintant press service confirmed the suit](https://habr.com/en/post/479968/)

    ¬†Quite the shake to the nginx world. Several folks, myself included, received an e-mail from F5 explaining the situation too early this week. But, it seems like a troll copyright claim taken too far. ‚ÄúNginx CEO believes the reason for the criminal case and searches was the sale of the project to F5 company for $670 million.‚Äù

    ¬†It would appear Rambler Group has been putting its attorneys to use to work this week. This is weird.

1. [December 12th, 2019 - Server / Workgroup Updates - Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/december-12th-2019/31735)

    ¬†‚Äù‚Ä¶following a review by IBM of its open source priorities, it has been decided that they will not be continuing to work on Swift in 2020. As a result, they are both standing down from the workgroup.‚Äù I had high hopes for Swift. The idea of a purpose-built mobile and backend friendly language really intrigued me. But, it never really took off. With IBM pulling out of the working group, I don‚Äôt think Swift will have an easy path to becoming a de facto backend contender. üôÅüôÅüôÅ

    ¬†‚ÄùThe crowded halls of the official Kubernetes conference Kubecon reflect a nascent but important technology whose best future might be to disappear into the background.‚Äù Kubernetes is not a destination.
1. [Despite Amazon‚Äôs legal challenge, Microsoft reportedly moving forward with JEDI hiring push](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/despite-amazons-legal-challenge-microsoft-reportedly-moving-forward-jedi-hiring-push/)

    ¬†Looks like Microsoft is preparing to deliver on JEDI despite upcoming challenges on the JEDI contract decision. I can‚Äôt blame them. The court cases could go on for years.

1. [Short Talks: A Conversation with Kelsey Hightower - OpenShift Commons Briefing](https://youtu.be/YYHp0oksor4)

    ¬†‚ÄùChris Short, Principal Product Marketing Manager, OpenShift at Red Hat and CNCF Ambassador sits down with Staff Developer Advocate at Google, Kelsey Hightower to discuss Kubernetes.

1. [RDS Pricing Has More Than Doubled](https://medium.com/@rbranson/rds-pricing-has-more-than-doubled-ef8c3b7e5218)

     ‚Äú[A] 78% premium? Now that gives me pause. Particularly because it is so much more and with no added value¬≤. This violates a core expectation of technology: it gets better and cheaper over time even if it was already worth it.‚Äù
1. [What is Kubernetes | Kubernetes explained in 15 mins (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnvRFRk_51k&feature=youtu.be)

     ‚ÄúKubernetes popularity rises constantly. So, what is Kubernetes actually and what problems does it solve? In ‚ÄòKubernetes explained‚Äô I cover Kubernetes basic architecture and concepts, like Pods and Services.‚Äù
1. [The Path Less Traveled: Abusing Kubernetes Defaults (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmoVSmTIOxM)

     ‚ÄúIn this live demonstration-filled talk, we are going to walk through the Kubernetes control plane before using sigs.k8s.io/kind to show some of the attack surface exposed by a default configuration of Kubernetes. There will be multiple exploits involving various moving parts, including cluster takeovers and host escapes. We‚Äôll show you mitigations, and then show you how to get around those.‚Äù

    ¬†If you need MySQL in Kubernetes (or anywhere for that matter), Percona offers some very compelling solutions. I know when is was working with MySQL every day, Percona Toolkit was a staple in my life. It‚Äôs awesome seeing Percona bringing these MySQL database tools into Kubernetes.
1. [Why Running a Privileged Container in Docker Is a Bad Idea](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/why-running-a-privileged-container-in-docker-is-a-bad-idea/)

    ¬†Like anything else running as root, if it‚Äôs compromised the entire system is. Say it with me, ‚ÄúContainers are not a security boundary.‚Äù
1. [Ansible for Kubernetes](https://www.ansibleforkubernetes.com/)

     ‚ÄúAnsible is a powerful infrastructure automation tool. Kubernetes is a powerful application deployment platform. Learn how to use these tools to automate massively-scalable, highly-available infrastructure.‚Äù Jeff Geerlin‚Äôs new LeanPub book.

    ¬†Spotify‚Äôs machine learning teams are second to none. Its third iteration is using Kubeflow Pipelines.
1. [This Week in Programming: The Time Has Come to Pay Attention to WebAssembly](https://thenewstack.io/this-week-in-programming-the-time-has-come-to-pay-attention-to-webassembly/)

    ¬†WebAssembly has been embraced by W3C. Bytecode Alliance was launched. Brian Ketelsen has been raving about it for a while now. I think it‚Äôs time we all start paying attention to WASM.
1. [CoreDNS-1.6.6 Release](https://coredns.io/2019/12/11/coredns-1.6.6-release/)
