## [DevOps'ish 094](https://devopsish.com/094) - Mon Sep 24, 2018

Shortly after <a href="../093/">DevOps’ish 093</a> went out last week, Linus Torvalds rocked the Linux kernel development community to its core with his note to LKML, <a href="https://www.lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/16/167">Linux 4.19-rc4 released, an apology, and a maintainership note</a>. In it, Linus apologized, “to the people that my personal behavior hurt and possibly drove away from kernel development entirely.” Also, a <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8a104f8b5867c682d994ffa7a74093c54469c11f">Code of Conduct</a> has been adopted by the Linux kernel development community.

<em>In my opinion</em>, this is a welcome change. But, I can’t help but think this is WAY too little, WAY too late. The sickening amount of toxic behavior in the open source software development world has used Linus as its scapegoat for decades. Some people are decrying the new Code of Conduct as ushering in politics that will lead to the downfall of the kernel development community. Decades of deplorable behavior towards humans has led us to this moment. I can’t help but think of the Jean de La Fontaine quote, “Our destiny is frequently met in the very paths we take to avoid it.” I’ll posit their desires for an environment free of politics and humanism would have been better defended by actually adhering to the principles in the now dead <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/code-of-conflict.html">Linux Code of Conflict</a>. “Be excellent to each other” clearly wasn’t enough. There is so much to unpack here and it has only been a week. More to come for sure. A quick aside, I see a lot of parallels between the kernel development community and the current US political climate.
