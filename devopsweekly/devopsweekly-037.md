## [DevOps'ish 037](https://devopsish.com/037) - Sun Aug 20, 2017

Being a manager is sometimes quite interesting. You have these odd moments of honesty about things you want and you try to make them happen. Sometimes those things are embraced and sometimes there are probing questions about them. This week I travelled to the Bankrate Florida office in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. While working in a geographically diverse company is cool, it’s sometimes good to meet face-to-face to assist culture changes. I think the biggest challenge in technology heavy fields is communication. It gets even harder when you’re over 1,000 miles away. How does DevOps help us solve that problem?

Typically, DevOps manages geographical differences through detailed ticketing and process. But, what if that doesn’t fit with your corporate culture. Work needs to be managed through tickets but discussion of new ways to do things happens organically. Getting DevOps involved earlier in the process is key but how do you continue to iterate and improve? This is difficult when you start talking about many product teams and your need to maintain flexibility with staff working amongst them all. Things to ponder… Feel free to respond with your two cents!
