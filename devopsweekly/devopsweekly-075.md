## [DevOps'ish 075](https://devopsish.com/075) - Sun May 13, 2018

Assholes seemed to be the theme of the week. First, Rafael Avila de Espindola is <a href="https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2018-May/122922.html">leaving the LLVM</a> project because it adopted a code of conduct and its support of <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a>. Yes, Rafael is arguing that creating a framework to foster a more inclusive community and helping folks that have are at a significant disadvantage is against his “ethical views”. Next, infamous bad actor, Richard Stallman, vehemently <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/753646/fdf5a92e1f87c69e/">opposed the removal of an abortion joke from glibc</a> source code. The basis for the opposition? “The fact that this is
not strictly and grimly technical is not a reason to remove this.” Because a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/753654/">GNU manual isn’t meant to be a “safe space”</a> according to Stallman. Finally, Josh Pigford suggested that <a href="https://twitter.com/shpigford/status/994583740943929346?s=12">changing jobs every 12-18 months was a red flag for hiring</a>. When numerous people called bullshit, Josh continually doubled-down even after <a href="https://twitter.com/mordorinc/status/995190017394819072">someone pointed out Josh had ten jobs in a ten-year span</a>. Instead of apologizing or better explaining his statement Josh hid behind the fact the responses to his comments were overwhelming and decided to “<a href="https://twitter.com/Shpigford/status/995008192429088769">not look at Twitter for a few days</a>” as a result. In my opinion, changing jobs every twelve to eighteen months shows you have a significant ability to learn and adapt. You will also have a significant experience advantage over someone who coasted somewhere for years because it was “comfortable”. All of these assholes were nice enough to self-identify. Make sure you remember who they are should you ever cross paths with them. The moral of the story is, we all need to be excellent to each other and helpful to everyone. If you are somehow against that for some reason then maybe you’re in the wrong line of existence.

     This is good news for US citizens. I’ll be honest, I’m considering getting a Pixelbook for travel internationally because of intrusive customs policies. If they were cheaper I’d already have one.

### Process

1. [SRE vs. DevOps: competing standards or close friends?](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/05/SRE-vs-DevOps-competing-standards-or-close-friends.html)

     There is a lot more in common with DevOps and SRE than most people think. In my opinion, SRE is the codification of acceptable risk, performance, and contribution of work towards metrics. Both require organizational buy-in. One statement I think applies across the board is, “Encourage moving quickly by reducing costs of failure.” You can’t accelerate software deployments without this thinking. I have been saying this for a very long time. SRE and DevOps are both ultimately trying to do the same thing; make software development and delivery be enjoyable.
