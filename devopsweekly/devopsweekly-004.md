## [DevOps'ish 004](https://devopsish.com/004) - Sun Jan 1, 2017

2016 has come to an end. For auld lang syne, my dear!

2016 has gotten a pretty bad rap (deservedly so, in my opinion). Let’s try to leave the past where it is, dump the negative energy, and wake up to new opportunities.

I like this time of year for the wrap-up pieces and year in reviews. Here are a few that I enjoyed this week:

Please, for the love of God, do not let leap seconds bite you in the ass ever again. Percona has a great piece for getting this problem solved: <a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/12/27/prepare-for-the-new-leap-second/">Don’t Let a Leap Second Leap on Your Database!</a>

<a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a> wrote a fantastic article (and comic), <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/">How to ask good questions</a>. Essentially good questions come from the need to plug information gaps, not from a complete lack of knowledge. Do your research then confirm what you need confirmed. This is a skill more people need to solidify.

I wrote a piece on <a href="https://opensource.com/article/16/12/devops-security-ansible-vault">Ansible Vault</a> for opensource.com. Ansible Vault is a super simple solution to encrypting files and variables natively in Ansible. It is not <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Hashicorp’s Vault</a> (don’t confuse the two) but Ansible Vault is <strong>very</strong> handy.

<a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/">Jeff Geerling</a> wrote up a great piece on <a href="http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/why-i-close-prs-oss-project-maintainer-notes">why he closes pull requests for his open source projects</a>. It is a pretty simple concept, they are his projects that he uses. If your PR is not useful to the intended use case it is generally closed. Submitting upstream is not a right; fork and go.

The Linux Foundation has created a credit card (yeah… so weird). <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/offerings/linux-credit-card">The Linux Credit Card</a> page states, “For every card activation, the Linux Foundation will receive $50 as well as a percentage of every purchase made with the Linux credit card.” I am scratching my head on this one.

CVE Details has a run down for the <a href="http://www.cvedetails.com/top-50-vendors.php?year=2016">Top 50 Vendors By Total Number Of “Distinct” Vulnerabilities in 2016</a>. Shockingly Microsoft is #4. Linux is #12.

Joel Sing pointed out this week that <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/tech@openbsd.org/msg36437.html">migrating to OpenSSL 1.1 is really (unnecessarily) hard</a>. I have to agree, it should not be as hard as he describes. Want a good example? Compile nmap configured to use OpenSSL 1.1.
