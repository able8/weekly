## [DevOps'ish 112](https://devopsish.com/112) - Sun Jan 27, 2019

I’m struggling to write an intro this week (probably broke a rib). But, I did write a tweet that got a lot more attention than I thought it would this week. I’d like to talk about it:

This is not to say I decline every meeting invite I get. It’s to say that if an invite is not complete (an agenda, location, time, etc.) I’m highly likely to decline it. Also, if there doesn’t appear to be value in my going versus something else I could be doing I will typically decline stating the reason politely. In general, I enjoy the meetings I get invited to because I love the work I’m doing. But, I did decline a meeting invite a little bit ago.

### DevOps’ish Top Five from Last Week

### People

1. [CEO of IBM Says Hiring Based on Skills Instead of College Degrees is Vital for the Future of Tech](https://gizmodo.com/ceo-of-ibm-says-hiring-based-on-skills-instead-of-colle-1831977815)

     I’m still grappling with this one personally. No, I didn’t go to college in the traditional sense. But, I also think colleges play an important role in our society. The real reason this is a topic here in the US is due to the enourmous cost of tuition. For example, we’re estimating Max’s (age 3) university tuition to be close to $200,000 USD. That’s the equivalent of ₹14,180,100.00 Indian Rupees, £151,521.00 Pounds, ¥1,349,460.00 Chinese Yuan, or €175,431.00 Euro.
