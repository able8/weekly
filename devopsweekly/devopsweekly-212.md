## [DevOps'ish 212](https://devopsish.com/212) - Sun Apr 4, 2021

An old headline rears its ugly head again this week. The company that now owns the remnants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Group?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=devopsish">The SCO Group</a> (whose claim to fame was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_SCO%E2%80%93Linux_disputes?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=devopsish">going bankrupt in suing Linux distro makers</a> until their dying breath), Xinuos, has decided to try this strategy out for itself in hopes of a different outcome. <a href="https://www.xinuos.com/xinuos-sues-ibm-and-red-hat/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=devopsish">Xinuos is suing IBM and Red Hat</a> for using Linux.

Talk about bringing back ancient memories of trying to keep up with a new and essential thing to me back in the early 2000s: Linux. Back then, getting your hands on Linux was a challenge, and Linux users were easy marks, according to SCO. Back in those days, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2666717/sco-to-sue-linux-user.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=devopsish">SCO even said it would go after individual end-users</a>. While it made Linux seem a little untrustworthy at the time to the outsider, insiders knew this was all bullshit. IBM was doubling and tripling down on Linux, and Red Hat was a public company. Yes, there felt like a potential disaster could happen with one lousy court ruling. But that day never came. It was a wilder world back then.

Now Xinuos looks to walk in The SCO Group’s bankruptcy-inducing tactics or threaten and harass Linux users. We knew better and told SCO to pound sand way back then. Twenty years removed, with history repeating itself, all I can do now is laugh. Really hard too. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinuos?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=devopsish">Xinuos</a>? Who? Lulz. Good luck on your journey to being the next “<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/67886/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=devopsish">Most Hated Company In Tech.</a>”
