## [DevOps'ish 158](https://devopsish.com/158) - Mon Dec 16, 2019

The year 2019 is winding down. This is the time of year I reflect on the past 365 days. I feel a few themes that are predominant but, I’m looking forward “for the next thing” and it’s still <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> and the cloud native ecosystem. This is why I think Kubernetes will become the standard cloud APIs that we all build on in the future. I look at <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/linux">Linux</a> and how it has become table stakes these days. I look at <a href="https://ansible.com">Ansible</a> and see that organizations are using either Ansible or a very similar tool. Seeing application deployment and infrastructure as code as more of the norm than the exception is great! Then there’s Kubernetes. The tool providing a consistent, repeatable, and extensible functionality to every cloud provider. While cloud providers’ lack of interoperability by design attempts to lock folks in (<a href="https://www.crn.com.au/news/aws-forbids-partners-even-mentioning-multi-cloud-529598">there’s plenty here for everyone, AWS</a>), Kubernetes is there making hybrid solutions possible. I see organizations using it to provide the right blend of on-premises and cloud resource use. I see folks using it for data science to make sure their models run to completion. I see folks building mountains of <a href="https://chrisshort.net/raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster/">Raspberry Pi Kubernetes clusters</a> to learn it. Kubernetes is becoming a standard API set folks are starting to expect to exist in data centers and clouds. When I look for what’s next in technology, I generally look for pain points. Kubernetes is solving some pain points and working on improving others with every release. Linux lowered the barrier to quality operating systems. Kubernetes is pushing infrastructure to be API driven. This is what we’ve wanted for <strong><em>years</em></strong>. It’s not perfect but, the future is now.

### People

1. [Malicious attackers are zeroing in on developers for their next big scoresptoolkit](https://siliconangle.com/2019/12/10/malicious-attackers-zeroing-developers-next-big-score/)

     This has always been a concern of mine. One of my projects early on after getting out of the Air Force was to conduct an educational wake-up call to my company. I setup  on the old, old Red Hat OpenShift (the one with cartridges; way before I worked there). This gave me legitimately signed TLS keys on a Red Hat domain. From here I could host a very fake but functional login page for login boxes from Google, Box, Microsoft, and Yahoo. The email was carefully crafted to look suspicious as hell to those that were security-minded already. I made sure one last time everyone in my section was aware of the number of folks we were targeting and whom we weren’t for political reasons. After a final confirmation the op was a go. Upon launching the attack my phone rang, “Chris, did you see this email that just came out?” I said I was looking into it. Instead, I watched the numbers pile up as folks clicked bad links, took another step to log in, and were surprised to be followed by materials that would help them to prevent such attacks for succeeding in the future. No one in the administrative and HR roles in the org ended up getting phished. However, the entire dev team did. If the attack were real, we would have been dealing with compromised credentials to core business applications. Developers are a weak link in the defense-in-depth strategy because they’re humans like the rest of us. But, the implications are greater because of the trust given to engineers over business-critical systems. These people must be hyper-vigilant when it comes to their credential safety.
1. [Do I need a college degree to be a sysadmin?](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/college-degree)

     No. I was a sysadmin and ran day-to-day operations for an internet service provider while I was still in high school. You don’t need a degree in this. But, you definitely need to be really comfortable reading RFCs and figuring things out on your own.
1. [Former Oracle product manager says he was forced out for refusing to deceive customers. Now he’s suing the biz](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/12/04/oracle_product_manager_lawsuit/)

     “For a civil RICO claim to succeed, the plaintiff must show that the defendant committed one of the crimes covered by the statute, such as mail fraud or wire fraud.”
1. [The Rise Of Open-Source Software (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpeDK1TPbew)

     ”Open-source software powers nearly all the world’s major companies. This software is freely available, and is developed collaboratively, maintained by a broad network that includes everyone from unpaid volunteers to employees at competing tech companies. Here’s how giving away software for free has proven to be a viable business model.”

     “At least two companies may have been dealt even more damage than the shipping giant, which lost nearly its entire global IT infrastructure.”
1. [When You Work in a Male-Dominated Industry](https://hbr.org/podcast/2019/12/when-you-work-in-a-male-dominated-industry)

     “Research shows that even well-meaning mentors direct female engineers into less technical, less valued roles. It’s no wonder so many women end up leaving the industry. We talk to a professor and two students at Olin College of Engineering about their experiences working among mostly men, what it means to “play nice,” and how male colleagues can help (listen!).”
1. [Google under investigation from NLRB](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/09/google-under-investigation-from-nlrb.html)

     ”The U.S. National Labor Relations Board has begun an official investigation into Google after the recent firing of four employees.”

     Gravity matters. Detroit has a chance to become a Raleigh or even one of these cities. But, when you look at some of the challenges the high-tech hubs have and the ones Detroit is facing, there are many lessons Detroit will have to learn earlier in its transformation. This will likely lead to better outcomes for its citizens than those of San Francisco, Seattle, and Austin. That’s my hope at least.
