## [DevOps'ish 164](https://devopsish.com/164) - Sun Jan 26, 2020

On my last trip of 2019, I took a very important walk with a friend. We talked extensively about burnout and recognizing ways to recover and mitigate the stress of our lives. I left the conversation in a much more peaceful place having just talked about. But, I’m not sure my friend did. The other day they sent me a <a href="https://youtu.be/gmj-azFbpkA">Shonda Rhimes TED Talk</a> that reminded them about my pledge a couple of years ago to say yes to everything I could. This pledge elevated me in some ways but, it had a very high cost in others. Clearly, this wasn’t an exercise in achieving balance. But, the video really drove home the importance of the “Why?” behind what we’re saying, “Yes” to. If we’re constantly working (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5yY9lUy8nbvjM1Uyo1Uqoc?si=KLc63v_nRE2dDfFqvtMBwQ">on the weekend like usual</a>), what good is the time we have on this earth? You created value but, did you value what you created? <em>Figure out your why</em> and <strong>strive to achieve balance</strong>.
