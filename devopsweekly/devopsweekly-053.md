## [DevOps'ish 053](https://devopsish.com/053) - Mon Dec 11, 2017

Last week, there was a giveaway of <a href="http://www.cnibook.info/">Cloud Native Infrastructure</a> by Justin Garrison and Kris Nova. There’s no need for a giveaway because you can now get <a href="https://thecodeteam.com/cloud-native-infrastructure-e-book/">Cloud Native Infrastructure FOR FREE!</a> This week’s edition is delayed due to <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/939474244152512512">adventures</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/939526934421295104">traveling</a> back from Kubecon (salute to those that stood up <a href="https://twitter.com/castrojo/status/939527794257813504">SIG-Airport</a>). I have to say that Kubecon had some of the friendliest people I’ve met attending, sponsoring, and running it. The hallway track was where I spent the vast majority of my time (also on the phone doing interviews). Brace yourselves for all things Cloud Native and Kubernetes.
