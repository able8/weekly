## [DevOps'ish 152](https://devopsish.com/152) - Sun Nov 3, 2019

I actually crossed things off my list this week. The little wins should be celebrated along with the big ones. There is something very therapeutic about erasing a line on a whiteboard or checking a box. That’s not celebration enough though. Make sure if you are doing complicated work that you take a moment to celebrate when it all comes together. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with feeling good about yourself. Morale is a huge part of this work. I learned this early on back in my military days and it has served me very well in the DevOps world.
