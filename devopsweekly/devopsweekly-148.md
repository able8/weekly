## [DevOps'ish 148](https://devopsish.com/148) - Sun Oct 6, 2019

The ever-shifting sands of newsletter writing, these are the days of our DevOps’ish… There are no paying <a href="https://devopsish.com/sponsor/">sponsors</a> this week. It’s not a problem but, it is a little discouraging. The best part about being a disabled veteran is that I have a funding source for this newsletter until I decide to stop. But, this newsletter does take a significant amount of effort, time, and energy. It’s nice to be compensated for that. <a href="https://devopsish.com/sponsor/">DevOps’ish Sponsorships</a> are affordable and available in one-month increments. Send me a note with how long you want to sponsor and what you’re looking to achieve with your sponsorship. We can be awesome together!

<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: The Short family is going on a vacation. DevOps’ish 150 will likely be a ‘best of’ issue (or maybe a beautiful postcard). If you have a preference or a better idea, let me know!

<a href="https://www.cncf.io/webinars/building-kubernetes-operators-in-an-ansible-native-way/">Webinar: Building Kubernetes Operators in an Ansible-native way</a> — Operators simplify management of complex applications on Kubernetes. They are usually written in Go and require expertise with the internals of Kubernetes. But, there’s an alternative with a lower barrier to entry. Ansible is a first-class citizen in the Operator SDK. Using Ansible frees up application engineers, maximizes time to automate and orchestrate your applications, and doing it across new &amp; existing platforms with one simple language.

1. [AWS billing is broken and Kubernetes won’t last, says irreverent economist Corey QuinnAWS newsletter](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/aws-billing-is-broken-and-kubernetes-wont-last-says-irreverent-economist-corey-quinn/)

     For a time longer than I want to admit, I thought the headline said irrelevant. I thought nothing of it because Corey would write a headline like that. “The most consistent mistake that everyone makes when using AWS—this extends to life as well—is once people learn something, they stop keeping current on that thing.” If you read this newsletter you’re doing yourself a tremendous service. Corey has an amazing  too.
### Process

1. [An update on Knative foundation status](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/knative-dev/YmL2vgMC4rc)

     Knative and Istio not being donated to a neutral third party is a little disconcerting. Like I was legit sad about it when I heard it. I don’t know if Google’s Open Source programs office has the wider cloud native ecosystem’s best interest at heart. But, I would welcome an alternative to the Linux Foundation to help the industry move forward faster too. Time will tell.
1. [Docker is in deep trouble](https://www.zdnet.com/article/docker-is-in-deep-trouble/)

     ”Docker has already raised $272.9 million, but the company hasn’t been profitable. It’s venture-capitalist supporters – ME Cloud Ventures, Benchmark, Coatue Management, Goldman Sachs, and Greylock Partners – which have seen it through Series E financing, can’t be happy, that after almost six-years, Docker still isn’t close to an IPO.”
1. [How The NSA And U.S. Cyber Command Hacked ISIS’s Media Operation](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/763545811/how-the-u-s-hacked-isis)

     This is an incredibly detailed account of a global cyber operation that was executed with extreme precision. It’s fascinating.
1. [Testing in Production: the hard parts](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/testing-in-production-the-hard-parts-3f06cefaf592)

     ”Two of the hardest problems of testing in production are curtailing blast radius and dealing with state. In this post, I aim to explore the topic of curtailing blast radius in more detail.”
1. [Detecting Agile BS](https://devopsish.com/pdf/DIB_DETECTING_AGILE_BS_2018.10.05.PDF)

     “The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to DoD program executives and acquisition professionals on how to detect software projects that are really using agile development versus those that are simply waterfall or spiral development in agile clothing (“agile-scrum-fall”).”

1. [Ask HN: Anyone Using AWX Ansible in Production?Look at how often that codebase changes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21137466)

     There are definitely people running AWX in production. There are so many little edge cases to solve as time goes on though. It’s definitely possible (just like most things are in tech). But, I do not recommend it.  and tell me you want to manage that at scale.

1. [PostgreSQL Change Data Capture With Debezium](https://info.crunchydata.com/blog/postgresql-change-data-capture-with-debezium)

     ”The most interesting aspect of Debezium is that at the core it is using Change Data Capture (CDC) to capture the data and push it into Kafka. The advantage of this is that the source database remains untouched in the sense that we don’t have to add triggers or log tables. This is a huge advantage as triggers and log tables degrade performance.”
