     ”Senator Marco Rubio has sent letters to the President urging further scrutinization of . [D]uring his failed presidential run in 2016, Senator Rubio took $4 million from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. It’s also worth noting that Oracle’s CEO was on Trump’s Transition Team.”

     ”White House officials in recent weeks have shown Trump a document that alleges a large conspiracy to award Amazon a 10-year, $10 billion contract to build the Pentagon’s cloud computing network, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The document, obtained by CNN, is identical to one created by Oracle’s top Washington lobbyist, Kenneth Glueck, an executive vice president with the company, Glueck tells CNN.”

    (WaPo) — ”The 11th-hour Oval Office intervention comes just weeks before the winning bid was expected to be announced and has now left a major military priority up in the air, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door process freely.”

1. [Why Kubernetes will disappearlayer 7Container-Optimized OS](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/why-kubernetes-will-disappear-10ffcfb39f01?gi=9107aafda7ae)

     This went viral, for good reason. The article discusses how, “the prize of ubiquity is invisibility,” which, in my opinion, is much the same way Linux has become the universal standard. Kubernetes will eventually be the  commodity on top of the OS (or the OS itself if you’re looking at Google’s ). This is good! It’s good because it reminds us all that while Kubernetes is awesome, it still isn’t the destination.

1. [5 Programming Languages That Are Probably Doomedreddit](https://insights.dice.com/2019/07/29/5-programming-languages-probably-doomed/?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=139)

     Ruby, Haskell, Objective-C, R, and Perl make up the list. I’m still blown away there’s as much Perl as there is in the world today. True story, my first job out of the Air Force was at McClatchy Interactive. The CMS that powered thirty-one daily newspaper sites was written in Perl. It was advanced architecturally though (some microservices, definitely some resource pools for different workloads, MySQL database sharding, and a lot of YAML). It ended up collapsing under its own weight but, more the weight of the market. It was the newspaper industry after all; the glory days had long past. But, to me, that was the last great Perl thing I worked on. What about you? Hit reply or comment on .
1. [IBM debuts integrations and consulting services for Red Hat’s OpenShift container platform](https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/01/ibm-debuts-integrations-and-consulting-services-for-red-hats-openshift-container-platform/)

But, “Over 100 products across IBM’s extensive software library form the basis of Cloud Paks, all of which are optimized to run on OpenShift.” is a logical way for IBM to do it.
