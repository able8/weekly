1. [My Time at Google and After](https://medium.com/@jennifer.blakely/my-time-at-google-and-after-b0af688ec3ab)

     ”In October of 2008, still living together, David [Drummond] and I attended a dinner in Palo Alto with other Google employees, many from the legal department. During dinner, our babysitter called to say our son was sick so I went home and David said he would be right behind me. Several hours later that same evening, I received a call from Chris Chin, the Associate General Counsel and a friend, who told me that David had taken two other women who worked for him in the legal department to San Francisco. I didn’t understand. Our son was very sick and I panicked so I called him several times but he didn’t answer his phone. Finally, I sent him a text message asking him when we could expect him home. He responded, ‘Don’t expect me back. I’m never coming back.’ And he didn’t.”
1. [Techies are coming together to program a geekier nation](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/techies-are-coming-together-to-program-a-geekier-nation/articleshow/70816677.cms)

     Fellow CNCF Ambassador, Neependra Khare, was interviewed by Times of India.

     “Here’s a primer on 10 key terms you need to know – whether you are new to DevOps or you want to bring a colleague up to speed quickly. We also contrast commonly confused DevOps terms”

1. [Don’t get locked up into avoiding lock-in](https://martinfowler.com/articles/oss-lockin.html)

     ”[L]ock-in isn’t a simple true-or-false matter: avoiding being locked into one aspect often locks you into another. Also, popular notions, such as open source automagically eliminating lock-in, turn out to be not entirely true. Time to have a closer look at lock-in, so you don’t get locked up into avoiding it!”
### Tools

1. [Project Pacific - Technical Overview](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2019/08/project-pacific-technical-overview.html)

     ”Project Pacific is a re-architecture of vSphere with Kubernetes as its control plane.” VMware is moving the management of workloads forward by pushing its entire platform to run on top of Kubernetes. This is a paradigm shift for the industry. This is essentially the beginning of the end for traditional virtual machines. Will VMs be a mainframe-like technology? No. People have been bitten way too many times for leaving their VMs alone for years and then trying to change literally anything.
1. [Introducing VMware Tanzu Mission Control to Bring Order to Cluster Chaos](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloudnative/2019/08/26/vmware-tanzu-mission-control/)

     Tanzu brings, “A SaaS based control plane will securely integrate with a Kubernetes cluster through an agent and supports a wide array of operations on the cluster. That includes lifecycle management (deploy, upgrade, scale, delete) of cloud-based clusters via Cluster API.” Single pane of glass matters and unfortunately the community maintained Kubernetes dashboard falls short in a lot of ways.
1. [Popular JavaScript library starts showing ads in its terminalstandardnpm has changed its policies](https://www.zdnet.com/article/popular-javascript-library-starts-showing-ads-in-its-terminal/)

     In a rather comical and wholly unsafe turn of events, a JavaScript library… is now inserting ads in its terminal.  package devs thought it’d be a great idea (it’s probably fine).  as a result. But, it is continuing the debate of how to fund open source development.
1. [Mutual Auto-Unseal Two Vault clusters in Kubernetes](https://itnext.io/mutual-auto-unseal-two-vault-clusters-in-kubernetes-465516da98f8)

     Use one Vault to auto-unseal another automatically.

1. [Someone Forked GIMP into Glimpse Because Gimp is an Offensive Word](https://itsfoss.com/gimp-fork-glimpse/)

     Pulp Fiction came out in 1994. GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) was first released in 1996. I first used it in ‘98, before I was hurt. I only thought of the Pulp Fiction reference back then. Gimp was a derogatory term long before 1994 and it never should’ve been named GIMP to begin with. I had to explain what Windows NT was to someone the other day. Before meeting me in 2010, my spouse had never seen Pulp Fiction. A rename is long overdue.
1. [Bootstrapping a Kubernetes Cluster on AWS with Cluster API](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2019/08/27/bootstrapping-a-kubernetes-cluster-on-aws-with-clusterapi/)
