## [DevOps'ish 110](https://devopsish.com/110) - Sun Jan 13, 2019

This week I ran an unscientific Twitter poll asking, ‚ÄúHas DevOps left Ops behind?‚Äù It was a question that came up during a discussion with one of my co-workers.

There will be more discussion and thought around this for sure. But, it appears the software industry has gotten ahead of the skillsets of the majority of folks in it. Think about it though. We went from containers going mainstream via Docker in 2014 to Kubernetes going mainstream in 2017. Now it‚Äôs 2019 and we‚Äôre talking about Istio, serverless, and eBPF. If it seems like the pace of change is accelerating, it‚Äôs because it is.

In Thomas L. Friedman‚Äôs <a href="https://amzn.to/2SSD4mr"><em>Thank You For Being Late: An Optimist‚Äôs Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations</em></a> a graph is drawn by Google X‚Äôs Eric ‚ÄúAstro‚Äù Teller like this one here.

<em>Note: DevOps‚Äôish may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href="../terms/">affiliate programs</a>.</em>

Friedman goes on to explain that the roles of education and government today should be to figure out how to lift the line of human adaptability to be able to keep pace with technology.

This sounds familiar‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs no surprise that we in tech have been trying to do exactly this for years in tech with things like DevOps and SRE (and many things before that). I think the fact we‚Äôve created ‚Äúthings‚Äù (DevOps, SRE, Agile, Lean, etc.) to help us adapt to change faster shows a clear sign the technology is outpacing human capacity to adapt to it. So what do we do about it? Looks like that‚Äôs the big question here.

     I did a thing because I felt I had something to prove.

1. [How Tilt updates Kubernetes in Seconds, not Minutes](https://medium.com/windmill-engineering/how-tilt-updates-kubernetes-in-seconds-not-minutes-28ddffe2d79f)

     Tilt is kinda in the same vein as Skaffold. It‚Äôs a high-speed Kubernetes deployment/development tool. It introduces something they‚Äôve dubbed a Synclet (a sidecar) that enables easy reuse of existing pods in Kubernetes as opposed to tearing the pod down, rebuilding it, and relaunching the containers in it. Pretty cool looking (I have not kicked the tires on it).
