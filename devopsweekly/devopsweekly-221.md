## [DevOps'ish 221](https://devopsish.com/221) - Sun Jun 6, 2021

The Cloud Native community lost a great person; <a href="https://github.com/cncf/memorials/blob/main/peeyush-gupta.md">Peeyush Gupta</a>. He leaves behind a wife and 10-month old child. His employer, Digital Ocean, and the Kubernetes community are trying very hard to make that that mother and child will not be <em>as devastated</em>. <strong>I beg of you</strong>, please donate to the <a href="https://milaap.org/fundraisers/support-peeyush-gupta-family-education"><strong>Peeyush Gupta: Family Education Fund</strong></a>.

<em>If half the DevOps‚Äôish readership gave $25, we‚Äôll hit the current goal of Rs.5,500,000.</em>

It‚Äôs been surprisingly difficult for me to deal with the loss of Peeyush. I think I‚Äôve learned death doesn‚Äôt get easier with age, at least when the person is a decade younger than you‚Äîmy deepest condolences to the Gupta family. I cannot imagine what you are dealing with right now.

I‚Äôve made two public statements on Peeyush‚Äôs death. Please accept my apologies for quoting myself here.

‚ÄúI was gobsmacked by the news. The impact Peeyush has had in the community is a large one. It‚Äôs not possible to sit down and look at GitHub to capture Peeyush‚Äôs work. It extended into so much more than code.‚Äù ‚ÄîChris Short, <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/WpTM45LCkRY">Heartfelt Remembrance for Peeyush Gupta (pensu)</a>

‚ÄúPeeyush made me look forward to going to the K8s Upstream Marketing meetings. I was devastated last week when I heard the news. But, he‚Äôs not gone, his work lives on through his code. He‚Äôll be missed deeply.‚Äù ‚ÄîChris Short, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1399782389589725191">Twitter</a>

    When I first read Apple‚Äôs policy, it was very apparent to me that the leadership at the company has not learned anything from this pandemic. If you work at Apple, I really do feel for you right now. Your psychological safety might be in jeopardy. There are companies that will be mostly remote going forward ( was mostly remote before the pandemic). If you need a referral into Red Hat, let me know.
