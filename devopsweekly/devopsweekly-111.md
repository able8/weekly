## [DevOps'ish 111](https://devopsish.com/111) - Sun Jan 20, 2019

I spent most of the week in Raleigh, North Carolina in and around Red Hat Tower. I was in a two-day All Product Marketing Summit. My boss is so amazing though. She asked how I was holding up at one point (that’s what builds psychological safety). My response, “This is kinda close to my personal hell. Not trying to be dramatic. But, ya, I’m super uncomfortable.” Then something rather Red Hat happened.

<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article224619300.html">Red Hat investors approve $34B merger agreement with IBM</a>. Jim Whitehurst decided to take the investor call to certify the investor vote in the Red Hat Annex where we were having our meeting. Jim is a dynamic leader. His time as COO at Delta made him appreciate process, rigor, and discipline. When he came to Red Hat, he adapted in a way most leaders might never have been able to. After the investor call, Jim decided to talk to us group of technical and product marketers. This is not your stereotypical group of marketing folks; there are Kubernetes and Ansible contributors in the room as well as Red Hat product contributors.

We grilled Jim with very tough questions. They were all answered with grace and candor. It’s rare that employees can see that in their CEO. It’s beyond refreshing to see this and I still look forward to being a part of this ride at Red Hat.

Although your organizational transformation probably won’t lead to war, it could be contentious. History can help prevent conflict when driving change. This talk will analyze human tendencies, historical data, and provide real-world examples of how to prevent conflict during your DevOps journey. <em>SPONSORED</em>

### Last Week’s Top Five

### People

1. [MacKenzie Bezos and the Myth of the Lone Genius Founder](https://www.wired.com/story/mackenzie-bezos-amazon-lone-genius-myth/)

     I fully recognize the fact that I’m able to do everything I can do because my significant other does a lot that I can’t. Be humble and thankful out there to everyone.
1. [Five Things To Look For On A DevOps Resume](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/15/five-things-to-look-for-on-a-devops-resume/#187255ec2cb1)

     The skillsets needed to execute DevOps are relatively rudimentary on their own. Finding folks with the combination of minimum viable skills required is harder than it seems though.
1. [The 50 Best Workplaces in Technology 2019](http://fortune.com/2019/01/17/50-best-workplaces-in-technology/)

     Congrats to Red Hat, my employer, on making #5 on this list. I have a similar list of places I’d be willing to work tailored to myself and my needs (in alphabetical order):

     The FAANGs have gotten so big the only way to correct them is through their employees.
### Process

     Hell yes you do!

    – Here’s your Kubernetes minimum viable security checklist.
1. [Atlassian admits it did Kubernetes ‘the hard way’](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/atlassian-admits-it-did-kubernetes-the-hard-way-517984)

     Literally the last thing I’d ever want to hear about Kubernetes, “Our clusters are as close to artisanal as you can get, I would say.”
1. [Kubernetes security: 4 tips to manage risks](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/1/kubernetes-security-4-tips-manage-risks)

1. [What startups should know about ITIL®](https://medium.com/@kaimarkaru/what-startups-should-know-about-itil-137195ba5694)

     The thing to keep in mind is that ITIL is a framework. If you treat it like a guide book people are going to hate you. With that being said, if your startup wants to be acquired at some point you’re going to have to think about the functions of ITIL and emulate them in your organization.
1. [Three things to look for if you want to earn more in DevOps](https://puppet.com/blog/three-things-look-if-you-want-earn-more-devops)

     This should be written as three things when looking for a job, period.
1. [MongoDB “open-source” Server Side Public License rejected](https://www.zdnet.com/article/mongodb-open-source-server-side-public-license-rejected/)

1. [Kubernetes vs. Docker: A Primer](https://containerjournal.com/2019/01/14/kubernetes-vs-docker-a-primer/)

     Docker is a container engine. Kubernetes is a container orchestrator. Docker, the company, has a competing Kubernetes project called Docker Swarm. Docker, again the company, also has a lot of products in the Kubernetes space too. I can see why this is confusing af to people now.
1. [Automating Datacenter Operations at Dropbox](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/01/automating-datacenter-operations-at-dropbox/)

1. [The Life of a GitHub Action](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/the-life-of-a-github-action/)

     GitHub Actions are a thing that I want to be good. GitLab CI is so far ahead here. It’s going to be interesting to see if GitHub tries to achieve feature parity or differentiates (or a little of both).

     Having used PriTunl for production work in the past, I might set this up just on the chance SSH tunnels don’t cut it for me someday.
