Last Sunday, shortly after <a href="../016/">DevOps’ish Weekly 015</a> went out, <a href="http://nicolefv.com"><strong>Nicole Forsgren</strong></a> of <a href="https://devops-research.com/">DORA</a> reached out on Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolefv/status/843422693273886721">demonstrate how easy it is to find great people in DevOps</a>. This is Nicole’s list of great folks out there DevOps’ing:

A utility company made a horrific mistake this week by letting a lesser experienced IT staffer represent their brand. Their page was not encrypted (HTTPS) so Mozilla was showing their page as insecure. The staffer filed a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1348902">bug report with Mozilla</a> (which is now locked). The IT staffer went so far as to claim the company <a href="https://twitter.com/konklone/status/843933144789213186">“has never been breached in more than 15 years.”</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRegister/status/843935688814862336">Within minutes of this bug report hitting The Register</a> the <a href="http://www.oilandgasinternational.com/">company’s site</a> was hacked and has been offline since.
