## [DevOps'ish 066](https://devopsish.com/066) - Sun Mar 11, 2018

One big piece of news from the CNCF this week was <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2018/03/06/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-kubernetes-first-graduated-project/">Kubernetes graduating</a>. “To move from incubation to graduate, projects must demonstrate thriving adoption, a documented, structured governance process, and a strong commitment to community success and inclusivity.” One questioned I was asked by a few people was what does graduating from CNCF actually mean? I asked around because it wasn’t really clear to me either when the TOC started voting on it. <a href="http://cshort.co/k8sgrad">Chris Aniszczyk responded</a>, “[CNCF Graduation] is meant to be a stamp from the Technical Oversight Committee and the CNCF of what is a sustainable, production ready and mature open source project (i.e., you can bet your business on it).” You can bet your business on Kubernetes. That’s been safe to say for a while now. The fact the ever growing and improving CNCF is now saying it makes it damn near fact.

I’ll be in Silicon Valley (Sunnyvale/Santa Clara) this week for the first time ever in my life. If you want to get together, let me know ASAP.

    The short answer is no. Your tools are your tools. I don’t talk to you about your hammer. If it drives a nail it drives a nail. Your tools are a personal choice. I find people’s choices interesting but I’m not going to dissaude you.
