1. [The Next Step for GenericsWhy Generics?a simpler design](https://golangweekly.com/link/90476/web)

     — Last July, there was a post on the official Go blog – Why Generics? – which addressed the popular demand for generics in Go. The Go team has listened, they’ve coded, they’ve tested, and they’re back with an update. Contracts are gone (hurrah!) and a simpler design is being proposed.
1. [A Draft Design for Type Parameters](https://golangweekly.com/link/90478/web)

     — Just because we know many readers don’t click on links within article summaries, we thought we should feature this.. it’s the actual proposal for extending Go with optional type parameters which would help with the implementation of generic types.
