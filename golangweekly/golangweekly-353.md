1. [The Go Developer Survey 2020 Results](https://golangweekly.com/link/104554/web)

     â€” Almost 10,000 gophers took the recently ran Go developer survey and the data has finally been crunched and various insights shared with us here. Some of the stand out points forÂ me:

1. [netaddr.IP: A New IP Address Type for Go](https://golangweekly.com/link/104555/web)

     â€” This might sound boring at first glance but itâ€™s both well written and itâ€™s by Brad Fitzpatrick (formerly on the Go team at Google). Why did Tailscale, his new employer, need a new IP address type in Go? Find out why and how they approached the problemÂ here.
1. [A Proposal for a New Security Policy for Go](https://golangweekly.com/link/104557/web)

     â€” You may have noticed that weâ€™re mentioning a lot of Go updates based around fixing security issues lately (thereâ€™s even one just below this item). The Go core team are considering introducing a â€˜severity scaleâ€™ for issues (so you can judge if a security release warrants a urgent upgrade, say) rather than them being treated as binary yes/noÂ matters.
1. [Go 1.16.1/2 and 1.15.9/10 Releasedthen followed](https://golangweekly.com/link/104558/web)

     â€” Go 1.61.1 and 1.15.9 were two small releases to address two security issues: a infinite loop bug in encoding/xml and a potential panic bug in archive/zip. 1.16.2 and 1.15.10 then followed almost immediately as more typical bugfix releases.
