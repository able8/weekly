     — Boasts being the most accurate natural language detection library in the Go ecosystem, although there aren’t many to choose from. This one supports 75 languages so far and can work with both short and long texts.
1. [The Go Collective on Stack Overflow](https://golangweekly.com/link/110287/web)

     — 'The Go collective' sounds a bit like the name of a gang (a cool one, honest) but it’s really a partnership between the Go project and Stack Overflow to offer an official place to ask and answer Go related questions, coupled with the ability for the Go team to mark various answers as trusted/approved.
1. [Reducing Memory Allocations in Go](https://golangweekly.com/link/110291/web)

     — Christopher works to remove ALL heap allocations from a function and prove that “premature optimization is the root of all evil” is, well, premature. Whenever the word unsafe pops up, however, you do need to take care.
1. [Go 1.17 is Deprecating the Traditional Use of go get](https://golangweekly.com/link/110292/web)

     — Technically it was deprecated in 1.16 but 1.17 is stressing the point even more, especially as old habits often die hard and the behavior is changing further in 1.18. Chris suggests go get could in theory become an alias for go install ...@latest, perhaps.
1. ['I Wrote A Book About Go' .. and Here's WhyOpenFaasEveryday Golang](https://golangweekly.com/link/110293/web)

     — Alex is well known in the serverless space, particularly for OpenFaas, and shares the news that he’s written his first Go ebook (Everyday Golang) along with why. It’s not cheap but does have a nice refund policy.

1. [Giving TDD a Go](https://golangweekly.com/link/110297/web)

     — Love it or hate it, Test Driven Development (TDD) can help you write better code, even if you don’t use it for everything. This week on Go Time, the panel dig into their experiences, provide some tips and tricks, gotchas, and best practices.
1. [How to Create Custom Handlers for Azure Functions in Go](https://golangweekly.com/link/110299/web)

     — Custom handlers are lightweight web servers that receive events from the Azure Functions host meaning they can be implemented in (almost) any language (such as Go, in this case).
1. [Scalable Event Streaming with Redis and Go](https://golangweekly.com/link/110300/web)

     — Here, the stream (trades) is dumped into a Redis queue which is read (and rate limited) and sent to Ably, a publish/subscribe SaaS platform.

1. [Smocker: A Simple and Efficient HTTP Mock Server](https://golangweekly.com/link/110304/web)

     — Smocker uses YAML to define mocks and responses, but there is a handy user interface, as well. Use it in your dev and test environments to cut out external services.
