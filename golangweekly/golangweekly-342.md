1. [Gnomock: Test Without Mocks by Using Ephemeral Docker Containers](https://golangweekly.com/link/100191/web)

     — The idea here is that rather that mocking services, you can use Docker to spin up an entire dependency stack to test against instead. Presets for things like Redis, MySQL, Postgres, etc. are available.
